Did not work for us,This did not work for my Mom who had a stroke.  The weight at the bottom kept getting stuck.  Straw didn't seat well.  Waste of money.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Too hard to use for elderly mom,"Requires too much suction. Person who would need such a device probably doesn't have the lung strength to use -- my mom didn't. Good idea tho.But the company refunded cost immediately and I guess bc it's a personal device, can't resell so I didnt even have to ship back.",2.0 out of 5 stars
very small amount of liquid dispenses,We were a little disappointed after trying the straw. We probably should have opted for the one advertised for 'thickened liquids' because this dispenses such a small amount that it is not practical for my husband who has swallowing issues following a stroke. Unless you are following specific recommendations from a therapist I think the majority of people would be happier with the 10ml straw. It also seems a little flimsy for the price.,3.0 out of 5 stars
I highly recommend this item for anyone with dysphagia,I highly recommend this item for anyone with dysphagia. This item was recommened by E.N.T specialist for my son who has chronic seizures.  Very easy to use and easy to wash. You can use regular size straw with it which comes separate.  Depending on the size of the cup or glass the straw will need to be cut to size suitable for drinking.  This item has been very useful and helpful for my son's condition. There is a small ball inside the tube to help regulate the amount of fluid the person takes in at a time. Worth the purchase.,5.0 out of 5 stars
