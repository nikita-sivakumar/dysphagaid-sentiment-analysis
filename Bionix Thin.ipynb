      "  Recommended by Speech therapist:The package came quickly and it did include **2 straws which because they aren't a standard size was a good thing.I tried it myself and as another reviewer said you can easily over power the reducer to obtain more liquid to cause choking.  Patient did it first thing at 95 years of age! But another important thing to note is if your loved one has memory issues they will forget they must release and either suck harder over powering it, or discouraged them to drink at all, which we found.Additionally they very quickly figure out how to pull up on the straw which disconnects the straw from reducer.  All of which discouraged drinking either by choking or frustation.I would only recommend for cognitive patient who just needs a reminder to sip slower.\n",

      "  is difficult to be the first negative reviewer mostly because the responsibility on nixing a product or discourage other people to potentially benefit from its use,It was recommended by the Speech Therapist working with my wife,she is a very professional and caring person who has care for her swallowing  difficulties secondary to a severe Parkinson's disease that has rendered her totally prone to chock and unable to swallow liquids.This product has potential,the idea simple on its design could be another tool,however, nothing is more infuriating than receiving a product that requires the customer to get in the car and start shopping for parts that should have been included to be functional,reminds me of the battery operated items that do not include them,or the artifacts requiring a cable not included etc.On a almost 12 dollars gadget like this the producer is not charging for materials as this is a very simple plastic tube with a floating ball like a car battery charge meter,understand what is been charged is really the idea and that is fine,however just do not send this tube on a little box and tell the buyer to go,. had  this tube have included a couple of straws (2 cents) and a plastic cup (30 cents?) will have made the difference between a complaining  buyer  and a happy one,poor marketing,not ready for prime time.Go back to your marketing consultant and ask for a refund on their advice.Oh ya,forgot,does it work? well it depends on many factors,as the amount of liquid available on suction is minimal.in order to bring a reasonable amount of liquid,the person has to develop a certain rhythm , and that is the weakest point, as it requires from a highly disabled patient to understand and WORK at it,if the patient is dysfunctional or highly disabled/impaired  then will pose a challenge and possible inability to use it. I do not think this gadget is meant to be a tool for drinking as much as a tool to wet your mouth.Sorry,you may try,can always return it,I think may do that after a few more days.August 12 updateInitial part with criticism of item remainsas for the use of this item,improved rating up one star.with much encouragement and patience my wife is learning to coordinate her sucking on the straw and time it for a reasonable flow,it certainly is safer than using a regular straw with the risk of a lungs aspiration.With available alternatives at an armed robbery cost,this unit is more than generously priced,hope could increase rating one more star,time will tell.August 13goes back,just does not work.\n",

      "  I received the Bionix Health at Home Safestraw Drinking Aid for Thin Liquids, the white one.This Straw Aid takes some experimentation and some time to get used to using it. After maybe a few minutes or practice, it works very well!I personally suffer from Dysphagia, a disorder where it can become difficult to swallow. For me, it seems to have been an inherited condition that I have dealt with since childhood. I do not have any mental illnesses or dementia, but since I was a kid, I always had trouble with choking on food or drink, and even sometimes just on my own saliva.My Dad actually died from Dysphagia, from just a simple glass of water! He was an otherwise very healthy person with no mental illness or dementia issues. Since he was a child, he always seemed to have trouble swallowing, so everyone, including him, just accepted that was the way he was. Since I also inherited this trait from childhood, no one in our family thought much of either one of us coughing or choking after eating or drinking, including me.One day when Dad was home alone, he came in from a run and drank a large glass of water, and he started to choke on it. He got some of that water into his lungs, (Pulmonary aspiration). He did not think too much about it at the time, but that particular incident caused infection, which developed into pneumonia. He took a turn for the worse and was finally hospitalized, but by then the pneumonia had gone too far and he died as a result! All from choking on a simple glass of water! So, if you find that you constantly seem to choke or have trouble swallowing foods or drink, please ask your doctor about the possibility of having Dysphagia!So, all that being said, it is highly important for people with these swallowing issues to be able to somewhat control how much they can swallow at a time by using small measured sips. This Safestraw drinking aid does exactly that, by measuring out the small sips and making the person more aware of their drinking/sipping habits.This particular model is for use with only thin liquids, water or water-like in consistency. There are other models for use with thicker liquids.After understanding how this Straw-Aid works, and trying it out for awhile, it has already saved me from choking several times now. Once the unit is properly primed, it takes about 6 seconds after each sip for the plunger to sink back down to the bottom of the unit before the person can take their next sip. It's no big deal after you get used to it, but it can be kind of difficult trying to explain that to a person with dementia.Another small issue is with the size of straws to use. Most of the straws I had in my home were either too small in diameter, or too large, like those boba straws. You need to have the normal sized 1/4 inch diameter straws to use with this Straw Aid. Plastic straws work the best. You can use the bendable straws and just cult the longer end down to a more manageable size. (BTW, you can recycle your plastic straws by washing them out for a few uses! That is what I do!)Anyway, I hope all this helps someone who may be considering this Straw-Aid. I am very happy with it and for my own personal situation with Dysphagia, it may just save my life!\n",

      "  Pros: Discretely dispenses 1 tsp of water or other thin liquid per sip.Cons: Requires a drinking straw to function. Inadequate instructions on box.This little medical aid device is designed to work when a standard 1/4\" bendable drinking straw is inserted into it's top. Depending on the size and height of the drinking glass, and amount of beverage in the glass, for comfort, the straw may need to be trimmed to size.Although it may seem like a standard, inexpensive household item, a disposable, bendable drinking straw, readily available in almost all restaurants, kitchens, schools, and hospitals, may not be available to someone living at home with swallowing problems who has been invalided by surgery or disease and can't manage, or finds it a burden, to get out to shop at the supermarket, or drug store to purchase what they may consider to be an unnecessary, additional expense item.This is compounded by the absence of clear instructions on the box. There are instructions on the Amazon product page, but it is unrealistic to expect that the person requiring and using the drinking aid has either purchased the device themselves, adequately remembers the instructions, or has the product page open when first trying out the device.When used properly, the drinking aid (with straw attached) is inserted into the water. A first sip is taken to \"prime\" the device which then doses a teaspoon of liquid up into the straw. This small volume of water can then be safely swallowed and the sip then repeated.This particular device is for water and other very thin liquids only.A second, separate device is designed for thicker liquids such as ones that have nectar or other thickeners added.A major benefit of this device is that since it is small and sits in the liquid with only a standard straw exposed, it can be used discretely in a restaurant or any other public place.Disposable, bendable paper straws are environmentally friendly and are hygienic.The device is top rack dishwasher safe.It is highly recommended that the manufacturer include instructions in or on the product box and perhaps if a few \"starter\" straws were included as well.\n",

      "  This BIONIX HEALTH AT HOME SAFESTRAW DRINKING AID FOR THIN LIQUIDS performs as advertised.  However, it has a learning curve--you must (1) sip with the straw you attach (not included) to fill the Safestraw chamber, (2) wait a few seconds for a float to return to the bottom of the chamber, and (3) sip again to drink the measured amount of liquid.This sip-wait-sip action is time-consuming, feels unnatural, and makes it a real chore to drink a full glass of liquid.  Also, I swallow extra air when I use the Safestraw.  I wouldn’t recommend this device for a person just because they have swallowing difficulties.  It seems appropriate only for a dysphagic person who is very unwilling to eat and drink slowly, and thus is in constant danger of aspirating liquid into the lungs.My retail package included NO instructions for proper assembly of the Safestraw.  When I took mine apart for cleaning--it’s dishwasher safe--the float fell out, and I discovered that the float is bullet-shaped (not a cylinder).  After some experimentation, and after examining the product page photos closely, I believe that the pointed end of the float goes into the Safestraw tube first.A disability aid like this one, that must be regularly taken apart for cleaning, should include a leaflet on proper assembly, if it is possible to re-assemble the device incorrectly.  This Safestraw is intended for use with thin liquids only (milk, water, etc.).  Another Safestraw model is available for use with thick liquids (e.g., carbonated or pulpy beverages).\n",

      "  Very important to note this white straw is for thin liquids only. If you need one for thick liquids you’ll need I buy the blue one. This straw helps prevent choking by limiting the fluid intake of a standard drinking straw. As the patient sips on the SafeStraw, the beverage flows through the valve and into the chamber causing the float to rise. After the float reaches the top of the chamber, the SafeStraw will prevent the patient from receiving any more fluid. Each sip will limit the fluid intake to approximately 6.2 ml (one teaspoon) allowing ability to control the liquid orally and safely swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  This straw was meant to work in conjunction with regular size drinking straws.  You cut off part of a regular straw and stick it on the end of this straw.  I have some straws that don't fit, so they don't fit all straws.  The patient has to sip once and then wait for the little doodad in the middle to go back down before sipping again.  Otherwise, the straw will get \"stuck.\"  Only a little liquid can be sucked in at a time.  That helps with preventing choking.  Thin liquids only.  You can't use this with shakes.\n",

It is all depending on how it's used and who is using it because it can easily be manipulated into failing and still allow choking. If you are able to instruct the person using the straw on the proper usage and they comply it should go over well but if the person using it cannot follow instructions or comprehend how to properly use it then it's a waste of time & money to try. I am giving it a 3 star rating because it really does depend on the individual using it as to how well it works but I will never agree to the price because it's just a simple plastic item and the materials likely cost only pennies.
