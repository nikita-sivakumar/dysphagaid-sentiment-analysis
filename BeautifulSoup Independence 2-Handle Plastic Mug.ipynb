But, the odds of our senior dropping his drink plummeted once he got this cup.  It is easy for him to grasp the handle(s) and easy for him to set it down when he is done.  The wide base on the bottom is such a help for those times when he may not get it quite flat before he sets it down. And, an unexpected plus was its light weight.  Until I picked up my coffee cup and his coffee in this cup, I didn’t realize how heavy a filled glass coffee mug was for him to handle.  I was a little worried he would not like the “sippy cup” design or would feel he didn’t need to use a cup like this.  But, wow!!  As soon as he saw it, he absolutely loved it, so my guess is he has been struggling mightily to manage regular drinking vessels and was just not letting us know how hard he was trying.  This cup was a hit with our senior and has helped me feel less worried about him dropping a drink.  Love it.\n",
