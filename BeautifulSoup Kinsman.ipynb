      "  I was looking for a device to control the amount of liquid dispensed in a \"sip.\" This cup does not work that way. The full amount of liquid in the cup could be dispensed in one sip even though you could make it flow faster or slower. Doesn't work for my needs - a person who puts as much as she can possibly hold in her mouth and then can't swallow it. I chose this cup over some marked \"disphagia\" cup as those dispensed only 1 or 2 teaspoons of liquid - not enough. This $40 cup is worth at most a couple of dollars. It is cheap plastic. The lid didn't fit securely and could be easily removed by a \"curious\" person. The tab which controlled the flow could not be secured properly. It felt and looked like something you would get at the dollar store. Don't waste your money.\n",

This kind of plastic is not appropriate due to lack of durability. Disabled adults often have motor and coordination problems, and thus this product needs to be made of a different material. It also didn't work well with thin liquids and was difficult to adjust to appropriate settings. It is a great idea, and I was hopeful that this would be just the right therapeutic cup for this individual. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I hope I can get a reimbursement for this.\n",
