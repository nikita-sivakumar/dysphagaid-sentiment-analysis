      "  I bought one of these for my mother who suffers from a Parkinson's type disease called PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) and has increasing difficulties with swallowing. She has limited use of one hand, so the big handle and weighted bottom are a plus. She cannot tilt her head up at all, and relies on a straw/sippy cup for liquids, so this mug allows her to drink coffee or other beverages more normally and is working fine so far. We bought the green one for juice. However, as things progress I can see that the cup won't work if the amount of liquid that comes out needs to be controlled; that's probably why one reviewer here said it didn't work for a person with Dysphagia. I can see we'll need to move to a portion-control type cup sometime soon. Note we have not had any problems with staining or breakage. Wash them both on the top rack of the dishwasher, and they are both used daily.\n",

      "  I bought this mug to help my 80 year old mom who suffers from severe arthritis. She loves the handle because the grip is large enough to put all four fingers through, no finger strength or balance is required.  The bottom of the mug is weighted which helps keep the mug level when raised to the mouth.  She has very painful hands, wrist, shoulder joints as well as a tremor.  She can swallow just fine so the name dysplasia cup doesn't do it justice.  This mug is excellent for RA and Parkinson's, and the curve of the lip works perfect. The user can enjoy any hot or cold beverage in control without spills.\n",

      "  This is a good example of considered industrial design. Its shape makes the use by patients easy. Careful design allows draining of the cup contents without the need to tilt the head back excessively. This feature helps to reduce the possibility of the contents \"going down the wrong way\".The base is thicker than the rest of the cup.This puts mass where it is needed to stabilize the cup.The handle adds  to the stability being part of the base; it is also wide enough to provide a firm grip.The cup is also dishwasher friendly although it requires careful placement to fit in our machine.We purchased almond and green cups.Both colours are satisfactory, however if we were going to buy again we would probably purchase almond.This is because we cannot see that the more expensive green cup offers anything for the extra money.Almed's delivery was prompt and the packaging was suitable for safe transit.\n",

      "  here's how to make  an alternate version:  I did not actually purchase this product, but the design made good sense to me.  Both my father and a good friend  of mine are stroke victims who have great difficulty drinking from a cup.  my friend has had aspirational pneumonia as a result.  you probably know that the trick is to keep your chin down when you swallow, but if your chin is down the cup hits your forehead before you can  get much fluid in your mouth.  The solution is a cup with one side higher than the other - a dysphasia cup.  you drink from the tall side, and the low opposite side allows you to keep your chin down while drinking.  I was looking for a low cost alternative to the relatively expensive cups I've found online.  I tried several things, but what worked best was also the easiest and least expensive to make.Here's what I did:1. Purchased some tall flexible plastic cups at the dollar store (3 for $1)2.  Used a pair of heavy duty scissors to cut the rim at an angle so that  one side of the cup was about. 1 1/2 inch higher than the opposite side.  I cut it a little at a time to get a nice even line that sloped from one side to the other.3.  Used fingernail files, 0000 sandpaper, and finally a nail buffer to smooth the edges that I had just cut.  I was able to get them perfectly smooth.The first cup took about 10 minutes to make, but once I had a pattern, the others took less than 5 minutes at a total cost of about $0.35  each.The proof was in the pudding - I took them to my friend who used them and said it made drinking much easier and he now drinks a lot more water than before.  SCORE!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  I bought a couple of these cups for my father in law who has ALS and they have been a life saver. He's not able to pick a normal glass coffee cup because of the weight or the size so this has been a great alternative. The handle is nice and wide so he's not trying to squeeze his hand in there. It's lightweight, but weighted at the bottom enough that it doesn't tip easily. The design of the cup is also nice because there's a wide rim so that his nose fits right on in there and he doesn't have to lean his head back while trying to hold the cup of coffee. Truly a great product for anyone with disabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The cup was fine. Unfortunately it turned out to be too heavy for my father, who has ALS, to lift. The weight had concerned me but I saw a few other reviews that said it worked well for a user who has ALS. It's likely their arm strength was greater than my dad's so it was a no go for me.The same design without the weight would be perfect for him, as it would allow him to drink without tilting his head too far back.\n",

      "  Very stable cups.  Helpful for those who can't tilt head back.  My father uses them and benefits from the large handle.  Easy to clean, dishwasher safe haven't broke after dropping several times.  $22 (or so) may seen like a lot for a plastic/acrylic cup, but after the first time using one of these cups, you will want to order a couple more. Such a simple thing like a slanted cup makes all the difference.  Really helps promote hydration and reduces spillage on shirt.  My father has PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy), which has similar symptoms as Parkinson's, and these cups have made it easy for him to drink.  He can't tilt his head back, as well as has problems with swallowing and aspiration, so we would keep topping off his cup/mug so that he could sip his drink without having to put his head back which would frequently cause him to choke.  Oye.  Get a couple of these mugs.  Once you use it, you'll want to have one available next time you take the person you care for out to dinner to to a friends house.\n",

The handle design and weighted base are helpful when the user's hand is unsteady.The oblong shape does assist in controlling drinking and swallowing.The cup is for either hot or cold beverages, easily washed, dried, and stores on any shelf.I would recommend either the almond or blue cup for your loved one with dysphagia.\n",
