"Not style pictured, handles made for baby hands.","I also received the cup with the tiny handles and a narrow base.  NOT WHAT IS PICTURED, NOT WHAT I ORDERED! Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Not made for adults,"This cup is being sold as an Adult cup, it is a babies cup. It is so small, the handles are way to small for an adult. Do not bother getting this unless you need it for a very small child.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Hot Liquids Take on a Strong Plastic Taste,"This cup is fine for cold liquids, but if you put anything hot into it, like tea, coffee, or milk, it takes on a distinct taste of plastic.  I had washed it thoroughly by hand before using, and tried running it through the dishwasher to get rid of the plastic taste but nothing worked.  The item's description says it is good for either hot or cold liquids, but I advise against buying it with the intention of using for anything but cold.",2.0 out of 5 stars
WASTE OF MONEY,"After reading the reviews, only a handful received the wrong cup so I took a gamble and lost. IF YOU CHANGE THE PRODUCT, CHANGE THE PICTURE.  This is actually fraud. I could buy this cup in the dollar store.  It's absolutely useless. I don't think a child could get all fingers in the handles.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Useless,"This was definitely designed as a kids sippy cup. My brother who has hand tremors took one look and said no. His arthritic finger couldn't hold the cup and CV he ani were a bit disappointed in the size i know it says it hols 8 oz. We soon realized every drink came in 10, 12 16 oz.  I couldn't even get my neighbor who has a 14 month old to take them. Into the donate bag.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Tiny,"The handles are surprisingly small. I can only fit a couple of fingers in without squeezing, making it awkward to use for an adult",2.0 out of 5 stars
Not Recommended,"I like having a 2 handle cup and though I checked making my coffee to fit the cup, the lid I wanted to use is to be inverted and if one did that, one would lose another ounce or so of coffee.  The sippy cup screwed on from the top but was difficult to remove.  I do not recommend to any average coffee drinker.I have ordered another company's larger cup.",2.0 out of 5 stars
For a child only,I bought this for my father. The handles are so small that only a child’s hands could grip them.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Lightweight and easy to hold.,"It was a gift for an elderly friend, who had a stroke.  She was happy with the mug.  Just to be safe, I heated the liquid in a glass cup in the microwave and then poured it into the two-handled cup.  She drinks slowly, so I don't know how long the liquid stayed warm.  It is not insulated.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Good product... just not for us.,"I know these work great for some.  Unfortunately, they didn't work out for us.  We ended up preferring the Kennedy Cup... sorry they just were a better fit.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Handles to small for most adults,This is a toddlers sippy cup. The handles are too small for my 85 yr old mom and the lid does not fasten in order to prevent spillage,1.0 out of 5 stars
It's a sippy cup for seniors,It's way over priced.  Just buy a cheaper sippy cup. It just about holds one cup. I have doubts about the microwave safe...it's the wrong sort of plastic,3.0 out of 5 stars
Exactly what I was looking for,"This cup is perfect for my 95 year old great aunt. She has severe rheumatoid arthritis in her hands, the large handles allow her to pick up her cup without difficulty. The double handles make it easier for her to hold steady.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Good for kids too!,"I actually use this for my one year old daughter for learning to hold a cup on her own. It's been successful so far. It's clear plastic and seems pretty tough, but I wouldn't put it in the dishwasher though. It's the size of an orange, so it isn't too big. The split is removable and easy to clean.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Handles should be larger.,It's like an adult sippy cup . There are 2 things that i feel would improve this item. First the handles are too small for adult twisted arthritic fingers to grasp. Secondly I feel a 10oz  capacity would be better than the 8oz.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Poor product.,Cups crack and leak at bottom center. Had to throw away half of all not orders. Product is in my opinion defective and does not stand up to claims made in marketing.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Not as advertised.,"My husband had a stroke and had to use both hands to guide the cup to his mouth.  I thought of the 'tommy tippy' cups for kids, then saw this cup listed as an 'adult', thinking it would be bigger and hold more than a child's cup.  It is not. I saw child cups bigger than this cup.  I am very disappointed in this product and the way it was advertised.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Very small handles,"This is identical to a child’s sippy cup without all the cute colors.  I bought this for my dad who is in hospice and having a difficult time lifting a cup. My mom wanted a lightweight cup with handles. It is both those things, but the handles are insanely small. Like 1 fingers worth for an adult man. Maybe this would work for an older woman or smaller person, but it was a huge disappointment for my situation. The picture shows me holding the cup. I can fit 2 fingers at most.",1.0 out of 5 stars
