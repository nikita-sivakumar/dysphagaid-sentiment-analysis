"Great for people who cannot, for whatever reason(s) drink from regular, open-top  cups","My bedridden husband can still drink from cups, thanks to this special design! I got depressed one day, worrying that he suddenly needed tube-feedings. My husband of 21 years had suddenly stopped easily drinking liquids, and was also, not eating food! He has advanced stage Parkinson's Disease and Dementia now, and he no longer could hold cups, nor drink from them without contents spilling everywhere. I bought a food processor, only to see that he still wants REAL solid foods, not mush. Still working at ensuring he continues to get proper, solid- foods nutrition. But these cups now easily allow for him to drink his Ensure Plus, his water, even Pepsi, and whatever else he still craves! And there are two drinking options: the sippy-cup top that lets him drink through a sprout, or the flat-top-with-a-hole, that lets him drink from the cup through a straw inserted through that hole. I prefer the sippy nozzle top, but my husband's brother sometimes uses that straw-through-hole top, since I guess he thinks that makes my husband look more macho (smile)!",5.0 out of 5 stars
She has very bad arthritis throughout her body and holding hot cups is ...,I bought this for my mother to try to heat up water in the microwave to make her coffee or tea. She has very bad arthritis throughout her body and holding hot cups is difficult and dangerous but with the two handles she can hold it safely. The description said it is microwave safe but I would not do it with the lid on. She heats up her water for 2 minutes with no issues as far as warping or any type of damage. Also the lid with the spout helps her drink if she is in bed. I would highly recommend it for anyone that is bedridden or has problems with their hands.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent producr,"My mom with dementia had a stroke and was having a hard time with drinking from different kind of glasses and cups for her water, hot tea, etc.  I tried many kinds.  This two-handled mug did the trick for her!  It will take hot or cold fluids.  The big plus is that she can see how much is in the mug as she's lifting it to her lips so can anticipate how to swallow.  The bigger plus is that she can manage drinking now independently so she now has more dignity when eating: hurray!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great Cup for Older Adults,We purchased this set of cups for my 87 year old mother-in-law. She has strength and balance issues along with essential tremors. These cups make it easy for her to drink from without spilling anything. The handles are easy to grab and hold. The base it wider than the cup making it easy to sit down as well.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent solution for hand tremors.,"This works very well for people with hand tremors or weakness in their hands. The cup can be held with one or two hands, gets pleasantly warm with hot coffee but not hot to the touch. The spout allows drinking without spilling, huge benefit with tremors. Lid is a tight seal. My mom loves it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
As described,"I bought these for my mother in law who is in assisted living.  They are as described but she is unable to use them as they are not 100% spill proof.  Again, they are not listed as spill proof, I just didn't read.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Great for anyone with limited hand mobility,"My grandma has arthritic hands that limit her mobility to grasp items. These mugs with handles help her to drink her beverages independently. She doesn’t drink anything warm, so I don’t know how they handle hot beverages. They do tend to crack after a year or two ( this is a reorder). We only handwash these mugs. My only complaint to improve these mugs is to make the lids easier to remove. With that said, these mugs with handles have changed my grandmother’s life tremendously.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Just what we needed.,"These 8 oz. cups are great. They have the volume markings on the side of the cup, making thickening supplements much easier to calculate.  I like that the cups come with 2 different types of lids,  so we could choose the one appropriate for dad. I purchased one twin pack and was so satisfied that I came back and ordered another. These are exactly the same cups that the speech therapist used in rehab.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Just what he needed!,"My 99 year old Dad has lost a lot of his fine motor skills, and I'd already switched him over to an adaptive plate and flatware when I found these cups. His immediate response was ""where have you been hiding this?"". I'm just sorry I didn't find them sooner! They're perfect for his needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Recommend,"Very pleased with this product.My husband ha Alzheimer’s and it’s getting very hard for him to use a regular cup.These cups came quickly,and well packaged.For us, they’re working great, my husband can use one handle on good days and two handles on not so good days.A big plus is they do not look child like and give him the dignity he’ll always have.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Easy to spill,It depends on why they are using these of course.  Don't expect them to last very long if they are dropped often.  They are hard plastic.  My elderly father would twirl them upside down and everything poured out.  They have no internal straw or spill resistant feature.  Good for those that regular cups slide out of their hands.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Didn’t work for us,I got these mugs for an elderly patient who often has trouble swallowing. She didn't like the sippy aspect. I didn’t like how hard it was to pry the lid off although I'm sure they need to be so tight to prevent leaks. Most elderly people would never be able to remove the lid themselves.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Needed this for my Mom and her room mate,"These arrived quickly and they were well packed and in great shape. My Mom's room mate has MS and she's happy to use these, as it makes drinking something an independent job. Mom likes the cups as well. Thank you!",5.0 out of 5 stars
LOVE THE HOLE ON TOP FOR STRAWS USE & NO TIP OVERS!,I use them for a special needs adult who can drink from a straw. The hole on top makes it perfect for that use. It is tip proof with the wide base design! The lids fit very snug. Safe to clean on top rack of dishwasher. They hold 10 oz of cold or gently warmed liquids easily.,5.0 out of 5 stars
All Cons,"Pros: none.Cons: drinks poured out of spout, closing “air hole” had little effect; drinks poured out of air hole when cup was tipped; cups look cheaply madeI was EXTREMELY disappointed. Sending back, of course.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Almost life changing,My buddy has Parkinsons and is sometimes very shaky. Until I bought this cup visits were fraught with struggling with spills. Now he gets to drink all his drink and I don't have to do all that cleanup.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Helpful Cups,"These cups are perfect for my elderly mother.  She has Alzheimer's and has lost strength in her hands.  After dropping a few glasses, we've found that these are much easier for her to handle.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great for seniors,"I ordered these for my 102 y/o Mother who has trouble using a glass.  The two handles make it easy for her to hold, it survived a crash on a hard floor and has a nice small spout to fit in her mouth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Helps my dad be independent.,I purchased these for my father who recently had an accident which left him quadriplegic.  He is learning to use his hands and these help his ability to drink by himself. It never leaks and burns him with coffee like the others.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Great for RA,Great product to maintain independence with  RA.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Broken lid,Cups seems like they will work well for the 93 year old we purchased them for. One of the cups came with a broken lid so we are sharing 1 lid for the 2 cups. This came in an envelope not a box so obviously at some point it was crushed or dropped I do not believe this is a product that should come in an envelope only,4.0 out of 5 stars
Good for someone with weak hands,I bought these 2 handled plastic cups for my mom who has carpal tunnel/ weak hands.She can lift these easily. I gave these cups a 4 because the lids are VERY hard for her to put on and take off.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Great product, easy to use/clean",My husband was almost completely paralyzed in his hands. He was able to get 3 fingers into the one handle and get it to his mouth to use the spout. It became essential to his independence after he lost his ability to use a straw. It did not require a strong sucking ability. He raved about these cups. Having 2 meant he could have an ice water nearby and his morning coffee.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Reduced spills,"The double handles make it easier for mom to pickup and hold onto this cup. The easy on/off lid seals well, preventing spills. Durable. Clear makes it easier to see inside. Love these cups!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Leaks at Seam.,Product continues to not stand up in dishwasher even though dishwasher safe.Great concept but have had to replace to frequently due to cracks then leaking from bottom where center seal is set.

Great cup for weak hands.,Cup is perfect for my mom who has very little use of her right hand and has weak fingers in her left hand.  The lid with the two small holes enabled her to drink sip her hot coffee comfortably rather than having to have lukewarm coffee from a straw.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Note Size,"This product would probably be good for children with small hands.  Honestly I did not pay attention to the size of it when purchasing it, for my handicapped adult brother it is too small.  However, like I say, it may not be fair for me to leave a feedback as I myself failed to pay attention to its small size that other customers I am sure will find just perfect.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Great for my mom,"Perfect for my Mom, who is in a memory care residence. I like that there is no design, as I didn't want my mom to feel self conscious.",5.0 out of 5 stars
COULDN'T DO WITHOUT IT!,Mom uses this cup to drink all her cold fluids.  She can easily see what is in it and lift it to drink with no problem.  She doesn't always use both hands but can easily lift it with one hand if it is not too full.  This purchase was to replace one that was cracked.  I purchased the two pack so I would always have a back up.  Thanks great product.  Delivered in a timely fashion.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Good for anyone who has trouble holding their cup steady.,The two handles give added support and balance to the cup. My mother is in Alzheimer’s care and the nurses suggested I get this for her. It’s really helped limit spills.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great cup, but eventually cracks",These cups work great for use with my Mom and have been approved by her speech therapist. The handle size is perfect. The disappointing issue is the fact that the cups will crack over time. I did not put any in the dishwasher this time and we still only made it about 2 and a half months before the cracks started. I then have to throw them away.,3.0 out of 5 stars

Three out of the four we purchased developed leaks in the bottom,"I purchased 4 of them and within a month 3 of the 4 developed leaks in the bottom. Slow leaks from cracks. Making them worthless.

Perfect for elderly people and for young children!,"These mugs were purchased for my 93 year old mother who has difficulty gripping her drinking glasses that have no handles. They are very lightweight, and have large handles on both sides of the cup. One ot the covers has an opening for a straw. The other cover has more of a sippy snout.  She uses the other cup for rinsing her moth after brush brushing her teeth. Yes, she still has all her teeth!",5.0 out of 5 stars
handy little cup,"I got these for the two handles that make them easier for my mother to hold steady. The built in sippy straw on the lid is a little too small which was disappointing, but I can put some pureed things in it without the lid (nothing hot or too much fluid) and she can hold it easily to eat out of it with a spoon, and can switch hands easily if needed.  Nice and lightweight and the small size is manageable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Perfect for my disabled daughter,"Bought these for my 5 year old with disabilities. After a small adjustment from tiny little kid sippy cups, she loves this. It comes with two different lid types, one with a spout but no spill control, and the other a sunken lid, like a travel coffee mug. The wide base makes it easier for her to set it down on multiple surfaces, such as the couch or her bed without it spilling. All in all, 10/10 would buy again.",5.0 out of 5 stars
My mom is loving these!,"Finally, a cup my 95-year-old mom can drink from without dribbling (she only has a few teeth).  These cups are just wonderful.  Be careful not to heat the liquid too hot, not because of cup durability, but because an older person might want to drink it when it's too hot and potentially scald themselves.  The cups are very easy to use and clean.  I would highly recommend them!  We are hand-washing to avoid potential scuffing of the cups.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Helpful for stroke patient,"My family member suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed the dominant side of his body.  If your loved one, like mine, cannot swallow without liquid going down the windpipe-- leading to pneumonia, etc.-- then this cup will help him/her to drink fluids independently.  The cup comes with two sipping options (holes/one bigger hole) and your loved one can choose the one that works.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Don’t waste your money!,This product is useless. It is described as “spill proof”. It definitely is NOT spill proof. It has a dipping spout which is great but it also has a hole for a straw (no straw included). Why would you need both? The drink pours out of the straw hole when the sipping spout is used. There’s no way to close it. This product is described as being for adults. That is the reason I purchased. It is useless for my disabled husband. Complete waste of my money!,1.0 out of 5 stars
WORKS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED,"I bought these to give one away as a joke for my friend's sixtieth birthday party...but I kept the other one for me!
