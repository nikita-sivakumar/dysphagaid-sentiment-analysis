Get rid of thickened liquids!!,"The SafeStaw is almost a miracle. After a stroke my Mom had to learn how to swallow again. After working with many speech therapist and steady improvement, one therapist introduced us to the SafeStraw to allow Mom to get off of the dreaded ""thickened liquids"". Mom just did not like the taste or texture of thickened liquids. The SafeStraw allowed her to return to regular liquids, especially with her meals. Please reccomend this to your speech therapist. We found not that many have ever heard of it but when they encounter Mom using it they are very impressed and ask for information so they can learn more about it. I can highly reccomend this for your therapist to consider for your needs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Nurses at our hospital came to see how this would work for their swallow patiences TRUE STORY,"My wife is swalling problems and we needed to restrict the amount of fluids she takes in at meals.We have about 5 SafeStraws, 2 for the house, one in our van for trips and eating out, and one in my wifes pack when she goes out with her care giver.TRUE STORYWe took it to the swallow nurse at the hospital and she was so impressed she had two other nurses come in and see it, the about 10 minutes later another nurse came in to see it.Well worth the investment to save someone from asperating while drinking fluids.",5.0 out of 5 stars
DO YOU WANT TO CHOKE?,"BOUGH THIS DEVICE FOR DYSPHAGIA, BUT MAKES ME CHOKE A LOT MORE THAN JUST DRINKING WITH A REGULAR STRAW. SO, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Don't waste your money!,"This item is completely worthless. It requires an incredible amount of suction to get anything out of it and the amount it releases is minuscule, too little to quench anyone's thirst, even for a person at risk of aspiration. Why bother drinking? To make matters worse, after such a tiny sip, you have to wait 1 to 3 minutes for the chamber to refill so you can take the next tiny sip. My guy just gave up on the beverage even though it was his favorite drink.As someone else mentioned, the parts are so tiny, I immediately dropped one into the sink drain trying to pull them apart (yuck!). I was happy to have found this as I thought it would be nice for him in restaurants and at parties and such to not have to haul around an adaptive cup but the cup is worth it if this is the alternative. And, of course the company will not accept returns or provide refunds for medical products (which this is considered) so no luck getting him a refund. :-(  So disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Good idea - doesn’t work well,So disappointed. We assembled this and got it working beautifully. It really helped limit the fluid volume to 5ml. It lasted about 2 days. Then it quit working. No amount of cleaning and reassembly helped. Sometimes the float will catch and control the fluid level. Sometimes it won’t catch and you get unrestricted volume. Sometimes it gets stuck and won’t allow any fluid. The. It got a crack in the side. Not worth it.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Works well,These work well for my mother with dysphagia. They do stain a bit though.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Worse there is a lightly fitting rubber plug on the ...,Close to worthless. Does release a small amount of fluid but then promotes continued straining to get a little more. Requires that the user stop sipping and then wait for the barrel to refill. Worse there is a lightly fitting rubber plug on the bottom and a small plastic piston that regulates the process. Both come out for cleaning and are extremely easy to loose. Poor design.,1.0 out of 5 stars
