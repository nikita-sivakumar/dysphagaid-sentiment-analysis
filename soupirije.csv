Helped make it safer to drink.,"We had to help my Aunt drink all liquids with a teaspoon...this cup allowed us to dial the amount of liquid, allowed for HOT liquids and SHE could hold the cup via either one or both handles.  That allowed her a small bit of  independence!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Works as advertised,"Wife has dysphagia problems and this device measures an amount of fluid that she can tolerate without chocking.  The plugs allow for various liquid thickness, which is important if thickener is needed.  I am happy I found this device and I recommend it.  My wife can not drink from it and has to use a straw.  I taped the straw to the cup and she can use it with no difficulty.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Leaks!!!,"This cup has a small hole on the bottom and it leaks. I have to Pay to ship this defective cup back to them to get another, no thank you. Way Too Expensive for a cup that leaks!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Holds only a few ounces of liquid,This is only good for someone in terrible condition.  It holds a very small amount of liquid.  My husband has a choking neurological disorder and he still needs liquid.  You would need to replenish this every few minutes.,1.0 out of 5 stars
