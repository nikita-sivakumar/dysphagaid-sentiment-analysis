I have used the only other brand’s version before a lot and it was always leak proof and great but this one has a hole at the back of the rim of the lid which isn’t covered properly by the rim of the main cup.. I thought this was to stop vacuum but is way too big and more comes out of it there than the actual sipping opening of the cup. Which my dad noticed and started drinking out of there which made the whole cup pointless as it’s meant to only let 5mls out at once. The lid doesn’t click in and doesn’t screw on it’s a push on one but it doesn’t seem to go all the way on one side, I tried with a lot of force it’s annoying it doesn’t leak there though so the actual seal would be ok if it didn’t have a hole at the back. It’s good that the handles are removable, as first I put both on but my dad held it the wrong side and was trying to  drink with the sipping bit down... so I could remove and he can work is out now. He does often think that the opposite flap that we can use to open it is the bit where he should be drinking from it so I need to remind him that it’s the other way.Though, if the cup isn’t tipped backwards, it wouldn’t leak that much but it’s hard not to when someone is ill and has coordination problems.I tried to drink out of the cup several times and we used it with thickened fluids and I had to tip it almost 180 degrees to get all of the 5mls out but that makes it quite safe and when my dad does manage to use it it is a safe way of drinking for him so I’m happy to leave the cup with him to drink when unsupervised.Overall makes me feel safer about his drinking but could be better.\n",

We purchased this product for my 82 year old grandmother who has difficulty swallowing, she aspirates very easily; this has caused her lungs to become infected with pneumonia. The doctor in the hospital suggested that we try this cup which we promptly ordered. Upon receiving the cup I noticed three major flaws:The cup itself is quite large and was a bit cumbersome for her (she is small and currently quite weak from the pneumonia). It was difficult even to hold it myself and help her to drink from it.In the amount of time that it took that one small teaspoon to travel from the bottom of the dosing core to the mouth she took at least four breaths. The whole point of this cup was so that she wouldn't breathe in the liquid. If she is breathing while the liquid is being poured into her mouth then that defeats the purpose.The angle at which she had to tilt her head (all the way back) to finally get the liquid into her mouth is flat out dangerous. To avoid aspiration one is supposed to tilt their chin down, NOT all the way back.While this cup may work well for certain swallowing disorders, I DO NOT recommend that you try it when attempting to avoid aspiration.\n",

The cups have a front and a back. I have never ordered a brand new cup, I've only utilized existing ones, in the directions it mentions a vent. It is obvious on the lid, but very hard to see on the cup, I can only see it if I hold it up to the light, but you can feel it if you run your finger around the rim on the inside. It also helps to not fill the liquid all the way to the fill line. I have seen a few people ask about putting thickened liquids in these cups; they are for thin liquids only. Also, your loved one / patient will need decent range of motion in their neck/shoulder to utilize the cups. Hope this helps!\n",
