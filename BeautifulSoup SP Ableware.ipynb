      "  I've ordered a total of 4 of these cups. They work great for drinking smoothies, creamed soups, and other similar foods. I've been unable to chew foods while waiting for facial reconstruction surgery and these have been the perfect solution. I was rapidly losing weight from not being able to eat before finding these cups.As the description says, they can be used laying down, but I use them sitting up. They're easy to wash by hand, or put on top DW shelf. I don't put them in the microwave, I heat the soup in a glass measuring cup first, then pour into the cup. I don't use any plastic in the DW. When my surgeon asked how I've been eating I told him about these cups, he was very impressed. He told me they will also be perfect to use after surgery during my recovery time.The only negative is that tomato soup does slightly stain the inside of the cup, but that's true of any tomato product and plastic. There's no residual smell or taste, just slightly discolored. When I noticed that I marked that cup to be the only one I use for tomato soup or others that may stain.\n",

With the cup, her intake is much greater with less mess.  The mouth hole size is very good and you are actually able to control the amount.  She has been fed in bed while slightly reclined.

The spout also decreases his confusion about what side to drink from when he is able to drink on his own. This is not spill proof, but spill reducing.

Previously we were using glasses with weighted bottoms because she has a tendency to knock them over accidentally, but the only ones she could grasp only held 4 ozs and we were having to buy new ones frequently because they were constantly being broken. I switched to these and I'm very glad I did. They hold 8 ozs and she has no trouble with them at all. I also like that they are top shelf dishwasher safe.
