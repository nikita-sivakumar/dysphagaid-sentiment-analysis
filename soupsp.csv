Nutrition Problem Solved,"I've ordered a total of 4 of these cups. They work great for drinking smoothies, creamed soups, and other similar foods. I've been unable to chew foods while waiting for facial reconstruction surgery and these have been the perfect solution. I was rapidly losing weight from not being able to eat before finding these cups.As the description says, they can be used laying down, but I use them sitting up. They're easy to wash by hand, or put on top DW shelf. I don't put them in the microwave, I heat the soup in a glass measuring cup first, then pour into the cup. I don't use any plastic in the DW. When my surgeon asked how I've been eating I told him about these cups, he was very impressed. He told me they will also be perfect to use after surgery during my recovery time.The only negative is that tomato soup does slightly stain the inside of the cup, but that's true of any tomato product and plastic. There's no residual smell or taste, just slightly discolored. When I noticed that I marked that cup to be the only one I use for tomato soup or others that may stain.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Lewy Who?,"This cup has been great for my brother who has Lewy Body Dementia (the 2nd most common form of degenerative dementia, after Alzheimer's, and includes motor control and stiffness, like Parkinson's). He doesn't have great control of his hands, so the small (but not tiny) size of the cup has worked well for him. He can get a good grip on it. He uses it with a flexible straw with the flexy part in the bottom of the cup, so if he's reclined the straw is still in the drink. [...]",5.0 out of 5 stars
A big help for the bedbound,"My father has late stage lung cancer and is now so weak that he is mostly bedbound. This cup has made drinking without spilling easier for him. Straws help, but require a lot of maneuvering to avoid tipping the cup too much. This, on the other hand, allows full tilting without frustrating spills. It also doesn't look like a child's cup, which would have embarrassed my dad. I love whoever came up with this. Thank you so much.",5.0 out of 5 stars
It really does help,"This is my second order.  I ordered the first one and it worked very well for my elderly mother who has trouble eating and swallowing due to vascular dementia.  I have mixed pureed food with a little liquid to make it more like a creamy soup and give it to her that way.  This cup has substantially decreased the amount of spillage when spoon feeding her.  With the cup, her intake is much greater with less mess.  The mouth hole size is very good and you are actually able to control the amount.  She has been fed in bed while slightly reclined.  Additionally, she likes the cup as well.  I use the first for soup/food and the second for drinks like Ensure.  Lastly, a great price!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Thanks to only two parts is easy to clean and sanitize,"I have 2 of these for my father who is on hospice and requires nectar thick liquids. It's spout hole is large enough for a larger plastic straw and accommodates the flow of thicker fluids. When he tips it to drink I can control the flow with the hole on the opposite side of the lid. The spout also decreases his confusion about what side to drink from when he is able to drink on his own. This is not spill proof, but spill reducing. Although the lid is simple to remove I have found it remains attached to the cup even when knocked over or dropped. Thanks to only two parts is easy to clean and sanitize.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great Lightweight Cup for Handicapped Adults,"The cup I received is just as pictured. I ordered it for my mom who only has the use of one hand and has trouble swallowing due to a stroke. She uses it with and without the lid and can easily remove it by herself with one hand. She learned easily how to control the flow of the liquid. Previously we were using glasses with weighted bottoms because she has a tendency to knock them over accidentally, but the only ones she could grasp only held 4 ozs and we were having to buy new ones frequently because they were constantly being broken. I switched to these and I'm very glad I did. They hold 8 ozs and she has no trouble with them at all. I also like that they are top shelf dishwasher safe. The lid stays on pretty well but will come off if dropped onto the floor.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great cup (for one day...),"Cup arrived quickly and looked promising. I bought this for my elderly aunt who has Alzheimers and is bedridden much of the time. She loved the cup, as she could drink while in a reclining position.  Unfortunately she dropped the cup at the end of the first day from her bed and part of the plastic broke off (see photo).  It's the part that you pry off and on to fill. I would have given it 5 stars IF that hadn't happened...and after just a a few hours use...I also bought some dual handled plastic cups and those were too heavy for her so this one would have been the ideal one.",3.0 out of 5 stars
These allowed her to lay in a more comfortable position and still drink,"Mom was bed-bound the last 6 months of her life. We had a hospital bed that allowed her to sit upright but it was uncomfortable for her. These allowed her to lay in a more comfortable position and still drink. I kept one always full of water by her bed. I also gave her morning juice and nutritional supplement in them. I ended up buying extras so I always had a couple clean. They are safe for hot liquids too, but she didn't like her tea in plastic - that was just her preference though and not a fault of the product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Disappointing, only for truly bedridden who don’t mind leaks.","You control flow by blocking the air hole in cap. Lid slides in, doesn’t screw in, so not secure. Take in A LOT of air, which after abdominal surgery is a no-no & you don’t sip out the end of the spout...it’s out of the top, which is wide enough for a straw. Lastly, measurements are NOT accurate.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Very helpful for my dad,"My dad has a health issue that is causing his swallow-reflex to weaken.  As a result, he chokes easily, and is weak enough that it can get serious.  This cup has dramatically lessened his choking.  The hole is on the side of the spout, not the end, and that simple change makes it much easier for him to regulate the flow of liquid, to avoid choking.  We have bought three of them now.",5.0 out of 5 stars
but this is not nearly as bad as the entire glass of liquid spilling,"My husband who has Parkinson Disease was spilling drinks often.  These cups work well.  If they do get knocked over a little liquid does spill out, but this is not nearly as bad as the entire glass of liquid spilling.  Yes, they are boring in looks, but the plain white manages to be not bad with other dishes.  they are reasonably priced with no shipping charge, so we could order just one to see how they worked before buying more.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Good for thick liquids. Lid comes off to easy.,"Cup design is great. Using for adult dementia who is on thick liquids. Only negative is the lid comes off to easy. She takes it off, or it flies off if she drops the cup.",4.0 out of 5 stars
disappointed,Lid is not snug in how it fits in to cup- would be better if it screwed on maybe. I returned as I was afraid my grandfather would spill the whole cup on himself if lid slid off. Amazon really helpful on return.,2.0 out of 5 stars
life saver,my mother has had several strokes and has advanced Alzheimer's. This has literately saved her life. She is unable to eat and drink herself so we can feed her liquid meal substitutes which has made her more comfortable,5.0 out of 5 stars
Vacuum control doesn't work. Not graduated.,"I got this for a client with dementia, and the vacuum control just doesn't work; I almost drowned him with it! The lid is slip-fit into the cup, so I don't think it makes a vacuum. It's not a bad cup, but the flow control was what we needed and what this cup's claim to fame was. It's also not graduated (marked like a measuring cup) as expected.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"While the idea of the cup is great, he is entirely unable to control his fingers ...","The product is as shown.  It make work for some, but the product info really needs to be updated.  It does not state that the user has to hold a finger over the hole, to control the flow of liquid.  I purchased this for my brother, who has end stage MS.  While the idea of the cup is great, he is entirely unable to control his fingers to cover the hole.  Thank you Amazon for processing my return easily!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Minimal flow control with water or thin liquids, leakproof lid, excellent straw holder","Bought this to help my convalescing patient (who was too weak to use straws) drink fluids.  The flow control is minimal with thin liquids, and the mouthpiece is awkward.  The mouthpiece seems to be designed to hold a straw rather than fit in the mouth.  And if you use this cup with a straw, flow control is unnecessary.  I could not use this product to give water and thin liquids to my bedridden patient.  It may work well with thicker liquids, however.  But the lid is watertight and I find I am using it frequently as a straw holder cup now that my patient is stronger.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Not good for bed bound people,Not good for my family member. Water shoots out the little hole if you don't have your finger covering it. Also the lid doesn't snap on or screw on it just kinda slides on. The lid came off several times. I ended up buying a toddler supply cup. Do not recommend this cup for someone that cannot sit up to drink.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Love This Cup!,"I got this cup for my ailing mother and it has more than met my expectations. Hubby was skeptical at first, but soon saw how much it helped mom to drink liquids more comfortably. Highly recommend it!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Child’s sippy cup works better than this!,"If you or a member of your family is bedridden and can’t sit up to drink and you order this cup for them, buy them a towel as well.  They will get wet whether they put a finger over the hole or not.  Flow is not decreased at all.  A child’s sippy cup works better and will prevent a soaking.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"A bit pricey for an adult ""sippy"" cup, but worth it.","My husband is starting to have issues with dysphasia. He felt comfortable with this cup right away as he can control the flow of the liquid so easily and slow things down. Easy to clean (I hand wash it). Thick durable plastic, not cheap and thin. He can be in a semi-prone position and still drink safely. It has also helped to eliminate accidental spills.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Good night table cup,I want a glass of water on my bedside table but more often than not I knock it over or spill it down my front as I try to take a sip in the night.
