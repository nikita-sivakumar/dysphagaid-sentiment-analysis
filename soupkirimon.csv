This cup is a lifesaver.,"Excellent produce!My mother (87 yrs old) is in a nursing home, under Hospice care, with throat cancer.  She is able to drink her meals, with this cup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Nice concept, but lacking in function",It works as long as you have a good sized coffee container and it is reasonably full.  Deep in a small or container or where it is near the bottom controlling the amount of coffee you scoop is difficult.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Safe,"Excellent for dementia individuals who have choking issues and need thickened beverages, no straw required, which is good, straws promote aspiration of liquids into lungs.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ease of handling, drink from.","Purchased for Alzheimer‚Äôs patient with difficulty holding items. The ridges make it easier and the ‚Äúsippy‚Äù spout keeps her from getting too much liquids at once with her difficulty swallowing, possibly choking.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Not as advertised,"Would love to give this no stars!NOT LEAK PROOF!!!! Not even close! Liquids pour out it easily, just having it on its side liquids drain out, beyond disappointment",1.0 out of 5 stars

Leaks,Would not stay sealed,1.0 out of 5 stars
Child-sized,"I was looking for a cup for an adult stroke patient and this looked ideal.  It is actually a child-sized cup, and I should have realized when I read who many ounces it holds.  Totally my fault that I didn't read the description more closely.  Still usable, I just have to refill more often. Other than that, it's great!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Great cup for advanced special needs users, straw drinkers and good hand/head control.",I would work great for special needs person with good hand mouth control.  Handle not secured made the ‚Äúremovable‚Äù but we needed it to be right/glued.  Moth spout was to long and kept hitting her teeth.  Great cup for more advanced users of special needs. Just wasn‚Äôt what we needed.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Not for elderly,Not anything like I thought... way too small for an adult. If used by elderly they have hold their head back.  Hard to hold.  Saw photos of a man drinking and looked bigger.  Very disappointed,2.0 out of 5 stars
Terrible,"My mother in law is blind so we bought this for her. It's terrible! Leaks, spills. I've never received anything that I did not like from Amazon, but this was not a good purchase. We will throw it out.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Handling for elderly,Poor. Cheap quality,1.0 out of 5 stars
Not worth it.,Not leak proof. Tip over and it will still spill. We actually put a straw in it 4 my dad since too much drink comes out when he tips cup 2 drink.  Only plus is I can usually catch him b4 all of his drink ends up on the furniture.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Not spill proof,It‚Äôs not spill proof,1.0 out of 5 stars
Disappointed,Product is fairly made. Handle unstable. Seal under lid falls out constantly when screwing on lid. Absolutely not spill/leak proof. I have to handle for my patients. Not as perceived for medical adaptive equipment. Entirely to costly for the poor quality of product.,1.0 out of 5 stars
worthless....,worthless...,1.0 out of 5 stars
Not at all leak or spill proof,Neither of the 2 lids prevent any kind of spill. Liquid will come out easily. The handle is so loose it promotes spilling.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Look for better product,Very small Cup and very thin material. Slip on handle is unstable. Not safe for a child and to small for audit use.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Not big enough,Not big enough,3.0 out of 5 stars
Too small,This cup is not spill proof. Disappointed,1.0 out of 5 stars
Dislike,The cup is very sharp at the top .. I washed it twice and both times I cut the top of my hand. The handle moves a lot doesn‚Äôt have a good grip on the cup itself,3.0 out of 5 stars
Ok Cup,This cup was smaller than I expected and the handle can move up & down slightly which made my 92-year old friend a little nervous when she first used it-so we secured it with a rubber band underneath the handle to stop the slipping. She also couldn‚Äôt tip the cup to her mouth to drink out of it so we now use straws in the spout and she likes that.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Not as describdd,Thus does not control flow at all. Can't be used.,1.0 out of 5 stars
