9,very small amount of liquid dispenses,We were a little disappointed after trying the straw. We probably should have opted for the one advertised for 'thickened liquids' because this dispenses such a small amount that it is not practical for my husband who has swallowing issues following a stroke. Unless you are following specific recommendations from a therapist I think the majority of people would be happier with the 10ml straw.

10,I highly recommend this item for anyone with dysphagia,I highly recommend this item for anyone with dysphagia. This item was recommened by E.N.T specialist for my son who has chronic seizures.  Very easy to use and easy to wash. You can use regular size straw with it which comes separate.  Depending on the size of the cup or glass the straw will need to be cut to size suitable for drinking.  This item has been very useful and helpful for my son's condition. There is a small ball inside the tube to help regulate the amount of fluid the person takes in at a time.

0,Mostly retired rehab nurse here.,"It's a good tool for someone cognitively intact. I would NOT purchase for someone with dementia and dysphagia, because it does require a certain amount of thought and reasoning to use. It would likely be beyond the capacity of most dementia patients.I'm cognitively intact and have dysphagia along with functional quadriplegia. I cannot properly form a liquid bolus, so I frequently get aspiration pneumonia from drinking.The straw forces me to stop, think, and swallow properly due to its mechanism. It took me a day or so to train myself to the actual process required to utilize it properly.I see a lot of people saying that this is not working well for people who have dementia or parkinson's. And I can understand why this is not for someone who cannot think through the actual process of the mechanism. like the person needs to be cognitively intact in order to be able to utilize this. It is the perfect tool for someone like me who is a functional quadriplegic but it's still cognitively intact and can work through how to utilize this particular tool. If a person does not have the ability to think through simple problems then this is absolutely not the tool for them. so someone with alzheimer's, lewy bodies, certain strokes where it has impacted their cognition, etc, would not be an appropriate candidate for this.I spent years as a rehab nurse and aid, only recently retiring in 2019. I still practice on occasion on contracts from home under administrative needs, but have a relatively good understanding of rehabilitation, dysphasia, cognition, etc. I have a progressive disorder which was the only reason that I stopped and it does not affect cognition. that's why I feel so free in saying who this may and may not be a good candidate for. And I am not saying it absolutely would not be appropriate for some people with dementia and other issues, but I'm saying that I can definitely understand why it would not be or why it would be extremely difficult to use even to the extent of the person not taking fluids.So a total thumbs up for people who are cognitively intact and can think through simple problems. Like someone who could do a 100-piece puzzle would be cognitively appropriate to utilize this particular tool. I gave it a thumbs down for people who are not cognitively intact, or could not work say a 100 piece jigsaw puzzle, because they would not be able to think through how to utilize this tool appropriately.but I've had great success with it over the past few days that I've had it. I've only choked once and it was very very minor and I was able to clear it quickly. And honestly, it was my fault.I'm also seeing people talking about quote overriding the mechanism. It's almost impossible to override the mechanism. so don't worry about that. I don't know what those people were talking about or if they have modified the tool slightly, but it's not a major concern.in my packages of the safe straw I did have two straws that came with it, which was another big gripe that I saw people having. So obviously they have made minor changes and maybe the safe straw before was a bit different and it was easy to override. The current model is not easily overridden, because I did test that out. I saw that so frequently mentioned that I thought I should double check it for both my safety and for the purpose of this review. I would list it as not a concern, because I have a pretty strong ability to suck on something to obtain fluids. I collapsed the straw into Oblivion and was not able to obtain excess fluids of the amount that should be able to enter the safe straw.I cannot attest to the safety of this for the use of pediatrics, so please consult a speech therapist or feeding expert before using. it does give the appropriate amount of fluids for a safe swallow for an adult, but again I cannot attest to the safety of it for pediatric utilization.",4.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.17439544252044248,0.5211772486772487
1,Frustration for memory patients discourages them to drink!,"Recommended by Speech therapist:The package came quickly and it did include **2 straws which because they aren't a standard size was a good thing.I tried it myself and as another reviewer said you can easily over power the reducer to obtain more liquid to cause choking.  Patient did it first thing at 95 years of age! But another important thing to note is if your loved one has memory issues they will forget they must release and either suck harder over powering it, or discouraged them to drink at all, which we found.Additionally they very quickly figure out how to pull up on the straw which disconnects the straw from reducer.  All of which discouraged drinking either by choking or frustation.I would only recommend for cognitive patient who just needs a reminder to sip slower.",2.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.33749999999999997,0.5651515151515153
2,Doesn’t do the job as expected,This device was recommended by a speech therapist for my wife who has PSP. I have not found that this device only supplies one teaspoon of water. My wife continually over powers it and winds up choking. I followed the instructions when I set up for her use. It would seem that the bullet on the inside of this device should longer to control the volume to what was stated in the instructions. I could control it better with a nose cup.,1.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.25,0.75
3,Bellow expectations,"is difficult to be the first negative reviewer mostly because the responsibility on nixing a product or discourage other people to potentially benefit from its use,It was recommended by the Speech Therapist working with my wife,she is a very professional and caring person who has care for her swallowing  difficulties secondary to a severe Parkinson's disease that has rendered her totally prone to chock and unable to swallow liquids.This product has potential,the idea simple on its design could be another tool,however, nothing is more infuriating than receiving a product that requires the customer to get in the car and start shopping for parts that should have been included to be functional,reminds me of the battery operated items that do not include them,or the artifacts requiring a cable not included etc.On a almost 12 dollars gadget like this the producer is not charging for materials as this is a very simple plastic tube with a floating ball like a car battery charge meter,understand what is been charged is really the idea and that is fine,however just do not send this tube on a little box and tell the buyer to go,. had  this tube have included a couple of straws (2 cents) and a plastic cup (30 cents?) will have made the difference between a complaining  buyer  and a happy one,poor marketing,not ready for prime time.Go back to your marketing consultant and ask for a refund on their advice.Oh ya,forgot,does it work? well it depends on many factors,as the amount of liquid available on suction is minimal.in order to bring a reasonable amount of liquid,the person has to develop a certain rhythm , and that is the weakest point, as it requires from a highly disabled patient to understand and WORK at it,if the patient is dysfunctional or highly disabled/impaired  then will pose a challenge and possible inability to use it. I do not think this gadget is meant to be a tool for drinking as much as a tool to wet your mouth.Sorry,you may try,can always return it,I think may do that after a few more days.August 12 updateInitial part with criticism of item remainsas for the use of this item,improved rating up one star.with much encouragement and patience my wife is learning to coordinate her sucking on the straw and time it for a reasonable flow,it certainly is safer than using a regular straw with the risk of a lungs aspiration.With available alternatives at an armed robbery cost,this unit is more than generously priced,hope could increase rating one more star,time will tell.August 13goes back,just does not work.",1.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.10151544401544402,0.47485248985248973

5,Great product but prepare for learning curve,This is a great product when used correctly and right viscosity of liquid. It has a purpose and does what it should to prevent aspiration.

16,Does Help Dysphagia Patients,"I received the Bionix Health at Home Safestraw Drinking Aid for Thin Liquids, the white one.This Straw Aid takes some experimentation and some time to get used to using it. After maybe a few minutes or practice, it works very well!I personally suffer from Dysphagia, a disorder where it can become difficult to swallow. For me, it seems to have been an inherited condition that I have dealt with since childhood. I do not have any mental illnesses or dementia, but since I was a kid, I always had trouble with choking on food or drink, and even sometimes just on my own saliva.My Dad actually died from Dysphagia, from just a simple glass of water! He was an otherwise very healthy person with no mental illness or dementia issues. Since he was a child, he always seemed to have trouble swallowing, so everyone, including him, just accepted that was the way he was. Since I also inherited this trait from childhood, no one in our family thought much of either one of us coughing or choking after eating or drinking, including me.One day when Dad was home alone, he came in from a run and drank a large glass of water, and he started to choke on it. He got some of that water into his lungs, (Pulmonary aspiration). He did not think too much about it at the time, but that particular incident caused infection, which developed into pneumonia. He took a turn for the worse and was finally hospitalized, but by then the pneumonia had gone too far and he died as a result! All from choking on a simple glass of water! So, if you find that you constantly seem to choke or have trouble swallowing foods or drink, please ask your doctor about the possibility of having Dysphagia!So, all that being said, it is highly important for people with these swallowing issues to be able to somewhat control how much they can swallow at a time by using small measured sips. This Safestraw drinking aid does exactly that, by measuring out the small sips and making the person more aware of their drinking/sipping habits.This particular model is for use with only thin liquids, water or water-like in consistency. There are other models for use with thicker liquids.After understanding how this Straw-Aid works, and trying it out for awhile, it has already saved me from choking several times now. Once the unit is properly primed, it takes about 6 seconds after each sip for the plunger to sink back down to the bottom of the unit before the person can take their next sip. It's no big deal after you get used to it, but it can be kind of difficult trying to explain that to a person with dementia.Another small issue is with the size of straws to use. Most of the straws I had in my home were either too small in diameter, or too large, like those boba straws. You need to have the normal sized 1/4 inch diameter straws to use with this Straw Aid. Plastic straws work the best. You can use the bendable straws and just cult the longer end down to a more manageable size. (BTW, you can recycle your plastic straws by washing them out for a few uses! That is what I do!)Anyway, I hope all this helps someone who may be considering this Straw-Aid. I am very happy with it and for my own personal situation with Dysphagia, it may just save my life!",5.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.07983848510164299,0.43595098858256753
17,"Has Learning Curve, Needs Assembly Instructions","This BIONIX HEALTH AT HOME SAFESTRAW DRINKING AID FOR THIN LIQUIDS performs as advertised.  However, it has a learning curve--you must (1) sip with the straw you attach (not included) to fill the Safestraw chamber, (2) wait a few seconds for a float to return to the bottom of the chamber, and (3) sip again to drink the measured amount of liquid.This sip-wait-sip action is time-consuming, feels unnatural, and makes it a real chore to drink a full glass of liquid.  Also, I swallow extra air when I use the Safestraw.  I wouldn’t recommend this device for a person just because they have swallowing difficulties.  It seems appropriate only for a dysphagic person who is very unwilling to eat and drink slowly, and thus is in constant danger of aspirating liquid into the lungs.My retail package included NO instructions for proper assembly of the Safestraw.  When I took mine apart for cleaning--it’s dishwasher safe--the float fell out, and I discovered that the float is bullet-shaped (not a cylinder).  After some experimentation, and after examining the product page photos closely, I believe that the pointed end of the float goes into the Safestraw tube first.A disability aid like this one, that must be regularly taken apart for cleaning, should include a leaflet on proper assembly, if it is possible to re-assemble the device incorrectly.  This Safestraw is intended for use with thin liquids only (milk, water, etc.).  Another Safestraw model is available for use with thick liquids (e.g., carbonated or pulpy beverages).",2.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.007894736842105246,0.44922402159244257
18,Helpful BUT No Instructions / Drinking Straw Required,"Pros: Discretely dispenses 1 tsp of water or other thin liquid per sip.Cons: Requires a drinking straw to function. Inadequate instructions on box.This little medical aid device is designed to work when a standard 1/4"" bendable drinking straw is inserted into it's top. Depending on the size and height of the drinking glass, and amount of beverage in the glass, for comfort, the straw may need to be trimmed to size.Although it may seem like a standard, inexpensive household item, a disposable, bendable drinking straw, readily available in almost all restaurants, kitchens, schools, and hospitals, may not be available to someone living at home with swallowing problems who has been invalided by surgery or disease and can't manage, or finds it a burden, to get out to shop at the supermarket, or drug store to purchase what they may consider to be an unnecessary, additional expense item.This is compounded by the absence of clear instructions on the box. There are instructions on the Amazon product page, but it is unrealistic to expect that the person requiring and using the drinking aid has either purchased the device themselves, adequately remembers the instructions, or has the product page open when first trying out the device.When used properly, the drinking aid (with straw attached) is inserted into the water. A first sip is taken to ""prime"" the device which then doses a teaspoon of liquid up into the straw. This small volume of water can then be safely swallowed and the sip then repeated.This particular device is for water and other very thin liquids only.A second, separate device is designed for thicker liquids such as ones that have nectar or other thickeners added.A major benefit of this device is that since it is small and sits in the liquid with only a standard straw exposed, it can be used discretely in a restaurant or any other public place.Disposable, bendable paper straws are environmentally friendly and are hygienic.The device is top rack dishwasher safe.It is highly recommended that the manufacturer include instructions in or on the product box and perhaps if a few ""starter"" straws were included as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.021597222222222226,0.3992592592592592

20,for thin liquids,"Very important to note this white straw is for thin liquids only. If you need one for thick liquids you’ll need I buy the blue one. This straw helps prevent choking by limiting the fluid intake of a standard drinking straw. As the patient sips on the SafeStraw, the beverage flows through the valve and into the chamber causing the float to rise. After the float reaches the top of the chamber, the SafeStraw will prevent the patient from receiving any more fluid. Each sip will limit the fluid intake to approximately 6.2 ml (one teaspoon) allowing ability to control the liquid orally and safely swallow.",4.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,0.06571428571428571,0.41607142857142854

Otherwise, the straw will get ""stuck.""  Only a little liquid can be sucked in at a time.  That helps with preventing choking.  Thin liquids only.  You can't use this with shakes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,soupbionixthin.csv,-0.010879629629629628,0.4243945868945869

This product has the potential to help certain people while others are still going to have problems.

If you are able to instruct the person using the straw on the proper usage and they comply it should go over well but if the person using it cannot follow instructions or comprehend how to properly use it then it's a waste of time & money to try.

It felt and looked like something you would get at the dollar store. Don't waste your money.",1.0 out of 5 stars,soupikinsman.csv,0.18555555555555553,0.538888888888889
1,"It is a great idea, and I was hopeful that this would ...","I work as a speech-language pathologist with adults with developmental disabilities. This cup didn't work because the plastic material cracked when the individual dropped it. This kind of plastic is not appropriate due to lack of durability. Disabled adults often have motor and coordination problems, and thus this product needs to be made of a different material. It also didn't work well with thin liquids and was difficult to adjust to appropriate settings. It is a great idea, and I was hopeful that this would be just the right therapeutic cup for this individual. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I hope I can get a reimbursement for this.",1.0 out of 5 stars,soupikinsman.csv,0.01620879120879121,0.6239010989010989

I had a question and submitted it to the manufacturer on their website but never got an answer. I bought it anyway because I will do anything for my wife. It really does not work for her but certainly could for others.

It claims to be dishwasher safe but the lid will get ruin in the dishwasher.  It will shrink.  The cup is very fragile. It breaks easy.  Very expensive and should be made from quality materials.  I just ordered three more after the dishwasher disaster. I have spent a total of $260 in less than two months.  I recommend caution with hot liquids and the dishwasher.

0,"Great for people who cannot, for whatever reason(s) drink from regular, open-top  cups","My bedridden husband can still drink from cups, thanks to this special design! I got depressed one day, worrying that he suddenly needed tube-feedings. My husband of 21 years had suddenly stopped easily drinking liquids, and was also, not eating food! He has advanced stage Parkinson's Disease and Dementia now, and he no longer could hold cups, nor drink from them without contents spilling everywhere. I bought a food processor, only to see that he still wants REAL solid foods, not mush. Still working at ensuring he continues to get proper, solid- foods nutrition. But these cups now easily allow for him to drink his Ensure Plus, his water, even Pepsi, and whatever else he still craves! And there are two drinking options: the sippy-cup top that lets him drink through a sprout, or the flat-top-with-a-hole, that lets him drink from the cup through a straw inserted through that hole. I prefer the sippy nozzle top, but my husband's brother sometimes uses that straw-through-hole top, since I guess he thinks that makes my husband look more macho (smile)!",5.0 out of 5 stars,soupindependenceplastic.csv,0.27675070028011206,0.44635854341736686
1,She has very bad arthritis throughout her body and holding hot cups is ...,I bought this for my mother to try to heat up water in the microwave to make her coffee or tea. She has very bad arthritis throughout her body and holding hot cups is difficult and dangerous but with the two handles she can hold it safely. The description said it is microwave safe but I would not do it with the lid on. She heats up her water for 2 minutes with no issues as far as warping or any type of damage. Also the lid with the spout helps her drink if she is in bed. I would highly recommend it for anyone that is bedridden or has problems with their hands.,5.0 out of 5 stars,soupindependenceplastic.csv,-0.06249999999999997,0.7695833333333334

This two-handled mug did the trick for her!  It will take hot or cold fluids.  The big plus is that she can see how much is in the mug as she's lifting it to her lips so can anticipate how to swallow.  The bigger plus is that she can manage drinking now independently so she now has more dignity when eating: hurray!",5.0 out of 5 stars,soupindependenceplastic.csv,0.13819444444444445,0.5555555555555556
3,Great Cup for Older Adults,We purchased this set of cups for my 87 year old mother-in-law. She has strength and balance issues along with essential tremors.

She doesn’t drink anything warm, so I don’t know how they handle hot beverages. They do tend to crack after a year or two ( this is a reorder). We only handwash these mugs.

She cannot tilt her head up at all, and relies on a straw/sippy cup for liquids, so this mug allows her to drink coffee or other beverages more normally and is working fine so far. We bought the green one for juice. However, as things progress I can see that the cup won't work if the amount of liquid that comes out needs to be controlled; that's probably why one reviewer here said it didn't work for a person with Dysphagia.

Careful design allows draining of the cup contents without the need to tilt the head back excessively.

10,Alternative version,"here's how to make  an alternate version:  I did not actually purchase this product, but the design made good sense to me.  Both my father and a good friend  of mine are stroke victims who have great difficulty drinking from a cup.  my friend has had aspirational pneumonia as a result.  you probably know that the trick is to keep your chin down when you swallow, but if your chin is down the cup hits your forehead before you can  get much fluid in your mouth.  The solution is a cup with one side higher than the other - a dysphasia cup.  you drink from the tall side, and the low opposite side allows you to keep your chin down while drinking.  I was looking for a low cost alternative to the relatively expensive cups I've found online.  I tried several things, but what worked best was also the easiest and least expensive to make.Here's what I did:1. Purchased some tall flexible plastic cups at the dollar store (3 for $1)2.

It's lightweight, but weighted at the bottom enough that it doesn't tip easily. The design of the cup is also nice because there's a wide rim so that his nose fits right on in there and he doesn't have to lean his head back while trying to hold the cup of coffee.

My father has PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy), which has similar symptoms as Parkinson's, and these cups have made it easy for him to drink.  He can't tilt his head back, as well as has problems with swallowing and aspiration, so we would keep topping off his cup/mug so that he could sip his drink without having to put his head back which would frequently cause him to choke.

I have used the only other brand’s version before a lot and it was always leak proof and great but this one has a hole at the back of the rim of the lid which isn’t covered properly by the rim of the main cup.. I thought this was to stop vacuum but is way too big and more comes out of it there than the actual sipping opening of the cup. Which my dad noticed and started drinking out of there which made the whole cup pointless as it’s meant to only let 5mls out at once. The lid doesn’t click in and doesn’t screw on it’s a push on one but it doesn’t seem to go all the way on one side, I tried with a lot of force it’s annoying it doesn’t leak there though so the actual seal would be ok if it didn’t have a hole at the back. It’s good that the handles are removable, as first I put both on but my dad held it the wrong side and was trying to  drink with the sipping bit down... so I could remove and he can work is out now. He does often think that the opposite flap that we can use to open it is the bit where he should be drinking from it so I need to remind him that it’s the other way.Though, if the cup isn’t tipped backwards, it wouldn’t leak that much but it’s hard not to when someone is ill and has coordination problems.I tried to drink out of the cup several times and we used it with thickened fluids and I had to tip it almost 180 degrees to get all of the 5mls out but that makes it quite safe and when my dad does manage to use it it is a safe way of drinking for him so I’m happy to leave the cup with him to drink when unsupervised.Overall makes me feel safer about his drinking but could be better.",4.0 out of 5 stars,soupprovale.csv,0.12759759759759762,0.46519519519519525

We purchased this product for my 82 year old grandmother who has difficulty swallowing, she aspirates very easily; this has caused her lungs to become infected with pneumonia. The doctor in the hospital suggested that we try this cup which we promptly ordered. Upon receiving the cup I noticed three major flaws:The cup itself is quite large and was a bit cumbersome for her (she is small and currently quite weak from the pneumonia). It was difficult even to hold it myself and help her to drink from it.In the amount of time that it took that one small teaspoon to travel from the bottom of the dosing core to the mouth she took at least four breaths. The whole point of this cup was so that she wouldn't breathe in the liquid. If she is breathing while the liquid is being poured into her mouth then that defeats the purpose.The angle at which she had to tilt her head (all the way back) to finally get the liquid into her mouth is flat out dangerous. To avoid aspiration one is supposed to tilt their chin down, NOT all the way back.While this cup may work well for certain swallowing disorders, I DO NOT recommend that you try it when attempting to avoid aspiration.",1.0 out of 5 stars,soupprovale.csv,-0.016730599647266316,0.521604938271605

0,Nutrition Problem Solved,"I've ordered a total of 4 of these cups. They work great for drinking smoothies, creamed soups, and other similar foods. I've been unable to chew foods while waiting for facial reconstruction surgery and these have been the perfect solution. I was rapidly losing weight from not being able to eat before finding these cups.As the description says, they can be used laying down, but I use them sitting up. They're easy to wash by hand, or put on top DW shelf. I don't put them in the microwave, I heat the soup in a glass measuring cup first, then pour into the cup. I don't use any plastic in the DW. When my surgeon asked how I've been eating I told him about these cups, he was very impressed. He told me they will also be perfect to use after surgery during my recovery time.The only negative is that tomato soup does slightly stain the inside of the cup, but that's true of any tomato product and plastic. There's no residual smell or taste, just slightly discolored.

I have mixed pureed food with a little liquid to make it more like a creamy soup and give it to her that way.  This cup has substantially decreased the amount of spillage when spoon feeding her.  With the cup, her intake is much greater with less mess.  The mouth hole size is very good and you are actually able to control the amount.  She has been fed in bed while slightly reclined.  Additionally, she likes the cup as well.  I use the first for soup/food and the second for drinks like Ensure.

It's spout hole is large enough for a larger plastic straw and accommodates the flow of thicker fluids. When he tips it to drink I can control the flow with the hole on the opposite side of the lid. The spout also decreases his confusion about what side to drink from when he is able to drink on his own. This is not spill proof, but spill reducing. Although the lid is simple to remove I have found it remains attached to the cup even when knocked over or dropped.

5,Great Lightweight Cup for Handicapped Adults,"The cup I received is just as pictured. I ordered it for my mom who only has the use of one hand and has trouble swallowing due to a stroke. She uses it with and without the lid and can easily remove it by herself with one hand. She learned easily how to control the flow of the liquid. Previously we were using glasses with weighted bottoms because she has a tendency to knock them over accidentally, but the only ones she could grasp only held 4 ozs and we were having to buy new ones frequently because they were constantly being broken. I switched to these and I'm very glad I did. They hold 8 ozs and she has no trouble with them at all. I also like that they are top shelf dishwasher safe.

I kept one always full of water by her bed. I also gave her morning juice and nutritional supplement in them. I ended up buying extras so I always had a couple clean.
