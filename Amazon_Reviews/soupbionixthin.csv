Mostly retired rehab nurse here.,"It's a good tool for someone cognitively intact. I would NOT purchase for someone with dementia and dysphagia, because it does require a certain amount of thought and reasoning to use. It would likely be beyond the capacity of most dementia patients.I'm cognitively intact and have dysphagia along with functional quadriplegia. I cannot properly form a liquid bolus, so I frequently get aspiration pneumonia from drinking.The straw forces me to stop, think, and swallow properly due to its mechanism. It took me a day or so to train myself to the actual process required to utilize it properly.I see a lot of people saying that this is not working well for people who have dementia or parkinson's. And I can understand why this is not for someone who cannot think through the actual process of the mechanism. like the person needs to be cognitively intact in order to be able to utilize this. It is the perfect tool for someone like me who is a functional quadriplegic but it's still cognitively intact and can work through how to utilize this particular tool. If a person does not have the ability to think through simple problems then this is absolutely not the tool for them. so someone with alzheimer's, lewy bodies, certain strokes where it has impacted their cognition, etc, would not be an appropriate candidate for this.I spent years as a rehab nurse and aid, only recently retiring in 2019. I still practice on occasion on contracts from home under administrative needs, but have a relatively good understanding of rehabilitation, dysphasia, cognition, etc. I have a progressive disorder which was the only reason that I stopped and it does not affect cognition. that's why I feel so free in saying who this may and may not be a good candidate for. And I am not saying it absolutely would not be appropriate for some people with dementia and other issues, but I'm saying that I can definitely understand why it would not be or why it would be extremely difficult to use even to the extent of the person not taking fluids.So a total thumbs up for people who are cognitively intact and can think through simple problems. Like someone who could do a 100-piece puzzle would be cognitively appropriate to utilize this particular tool. I gave it a thumbs down for people who are not cognitively intact, or could not work say a 100 piece jigsaw puzzle, because they would not be able to think through how to utilize this tool appropriately.but I've had great success with it over the past few days that I've had it. I've only choked once and it was very very minor and I was able to clear it quickly. And honestly, it was my fault.I'm also seeing people talking about quote overriding the mechanism. It's almost impossible to override the mechanism. so don't worry about that. I don't know what those people were talking about or if they have modified the tool slightly, but it's not a major concern.in my packages of the safe straw I did have two straws that came with it, which was another big gripe that I saw people having. So obviously they have made minor changes and maybe the safe straw before was a bit different and it was easy to override. The current model is not easily overridden, because I did test that out. I saw that so frequently mentioned that I thought I should double check it for both my safety and for the purpose of this review. I would list it as not a concern, because I have a pretty strong ability to suck on something to obtain fluids. I collapsed the straw into Oblivion and was not able to obtain excess fluids of the amount that should be able to enter the safe straw.I cannot attest to the safety of this for the use of pediatrics, so please consult a speech therapist or feeding expert before using. it does give the appropriate amount of fluids for a safe swallow for an adult, but again I cannot attest to the safety of it for pediatric utilization.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Frustration for memory patients discourages them to drink!,"Recommended by Speech therapist:The package came quickly and it did include **2 straws which because they aren't a standard size was a good thing.I tried it myself and as another reviewer said you can easily over power the reducer to obtain more liquid to cause choking.  Patient did it first thing at 95 years of age! But another important thing to note is if your loved one has memory issues they will forget they must release and either suck harder over powering it, or discouraged them to drink at all, which we found.Additionally they very quickly figure out how to pull up on the straw which disconnects the straw from reducer.  All of which discouraged drinking either by choking or frustation.I would only recommend for cognitive patient who just needs a reminder to sip slower.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Doesn’t do the job as expected,This device was recommended by a speech therapist for my wife who has PSP. I have not found that this device only supplies one teaspoon of water. My wife continually over powers it and winds up choking. I followed the instructions when I set up for her use. It would seem that the bullet on the inside of this device should longer to control the volume to what was stated in the instructions. I could control it better with a nose cup.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Bellow expectations,"is difficult to be the first negative reviewer mostly because the responsibility on nixing a product or discourage other people to potentially benefit from its use,It was recommended by the Speech Therapist working with my wife,she is a very professional and caring person who has care for her swallowing  difficulties secondary to a severe Parkinson's disease that has rendered her totally prone to chock and unable to swallow liquids.This product has potential,the idea simple on its design could be another tool,however, nothing is more infuriating than receiving a product that requires the customer to get in the car and start shopping for parts that should have been included to be functional,reminds me of the battery operated items that do not include them,or the artifacts requiring a cable not included etc.On a almost 12 dollars gadget like this the producer is not charging for materials as this is a very simple plastic tube with a floating ball like a car battery charge meter,understand what is been charged is really the idea and that is fine,however just do not send this tube on a little box and tell the buyer to go,. had  this tube have included a couple of straws (2 cents) and a plastic cup (30 cents?) will have made the difference between a complaining  buyer  and a happy one,poor marketing,not ready for prime time.Go back to your marketing consultant and ask for a refund on their advice.Oh ya,forgot,does it work? well it depends on many factors,as the amount of liquid available on suction is minimal.in order to bring a reasonable amount of liquid,the person has to develop a certain rhythm , and that is the weakest point, as it requires from a highly disabled patient to understand and WORK at it,if the patient is dysfunctional or highly disabled/impaired  then will pose a challenge and possible inability to use it. I do not think this gadget is meant to be a tool for drinking as much as a tool to wet your mouth.Sorry,you may try,can always return it,I think may do that after a few more days.August 12 updateInitial part with criticism of item remainsas for the use of this item,improved rating up one star.with much encouragement and patience my wife is learning to coordinate her sucking on the straw and time it for a reasonable flow,it certainly is safer than using a regular straw with the risk of a lungs aspiration.With available alternatives at an armed robbery cost,this unit is more than generously priced,hope could increase rating one more star,time will tell.August 13goes back,just does not work.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent product,"Item worked beyond expectations. My aunt can now drink through a straw again without getting choked. Good for stroke patients or anyone who has an issue with drinking too quickly. Item arrived less than 24 hours after we placed the order. We are very grateful as we couldn't find this product at any of our local medical equipment or home health stores. Thank you so much, highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great product but prepare for learning curve,This is a great product when used correctly and right viscosity of liquid. It has a purpose and does what it should to prevent aspiration. That being said be prepared for person drinking hating it at first and be ready to encourage them it will supply a small sip which they can swallow safely. Sucking harder won't help.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Doesn't work,Did not work the way I was expecting. Tried it with my patient and they quickly over powered it and got too much liquid at one time. Very disappointed. I was hopeful.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Works ok,Works ok most of the time if you don’t over power it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Didn't Work,This doesn't work! It still allows too much water into the mouth.,1.0 out of 5 stars
Helps with swallowing,This accessory to the straw helps with drinking water and other liquids in that the accessory allows only a sip at a time.  This prevents choking on ppl that need help with swallowing.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Does Help Dysphagia Patients,"I received the Bionix Health at Home Safestraw Drinking Aid for Thin Liquids, the white one.This Straw Aid takes some experimentation and some time to get used to using it. After maybe a few minutes or practice, it works very well!I personally suffer from Dysphagia, a disorder where it can become difficult to swallow. For me, it seems to have been an inherited condition that I have dealt with since childhood. I do not have any mental illnesses or dementia, but since I was a kid, I always had trouble with choking on food or drink, and even sometimes just on my own saliva.My Dad actually died from Dysphagia, from just a simple glass of water! He was an otherwise very healthy person with no mental illness or dementia issues. Since he was a child, he always seemed to have trouble swallowing, so everyone, including him, just accepted that was the way he was. Since I also inherited this trait from childhood, no one in our family thought much of either one of us coughing or choking after eating or drinking, including me.One day when Dad was home alone, he came in from a run and drank a large glass of water, and he started to choke on it. He got some of that water into his lungs, (Pulmonary aspiration). He did not think too much about it at the time, but that particular incident caused infection, which developed into pneumonia. He took a turn for the worse and was finally hospitalized, but by then the pneumonia had gone too far and he died as a result! All from choking on a simple glass of water! So, if you find that you constantly seem to choke or have trouble swallowing foods or drink, please ask your doctor about the possibility of having Dysphagia!So, all that being said, it is highly important for people with these swallowing issues to be able to somewhat control how much they can swallow at a time by using small measured sips. This Safestraw drinking aid does exactly that, by measuring out the small sips and making the person more aware of their drinking/sipping habits.This particular model is for use with only thin liquids, water or water-like in consistency. There are other models for use with thicker liquids.After understanding how this Straw-Aid works, and trying it out for awhile, it has already saved me from choking several times now. Once the unit is properly primed, it takes about 6 seconds after each sip for the plunger to sink back down to the bottom of the unit before the person can take their next sip. It's no big deal after you get used to it, but it can be kind of difficult trying to explain that to a person with dementia.Another small issue is with the size of straws to use. Most of the straws I had in my home were either too small in diameter, or too large, like those boba straws. You need to have the normal sized 1/4 inch diameter straws to use with this Straw Aid. Plastic straws work the best. You can use the bendable straws and just cult the longer end down to a more manageable size. (BTW, you can recycle your plastic straws by washing them out for a few uses! That is what I do!)Anyway, I hope all this helps someone who may be considering this Straw-Aid. I am very happy with it and for my own personal situation with Dysphagia, it may just save my life!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Has Learning Curve, Needs Assembly Instructions","This BIONIX HEALTH AT HOME SAFESTRAW DRINKING AID FOR THIN LIQUIDS performs as advertised.  However, it has a learning curve--you must (1) sip with the straw you attach (not included) to fill the Safestraw chamber, (2) wait a few seconds for a float to return to the bottom of the chamber, and (3) sip again to drink the measured amount of liquid.This sip-wait-sip action is time-consuming, feels unnatural, and makes it a real chore to drink a full glass of liquid.  Also, I swallow extra air when I use the Safestraw.  I wouldn’t recommend this device for a person just because they have swallowing difficulties.  It seems appropriate only for a dysphagic person who is very unwilling to eat and drink slowly, and thus is in constant danger of aspirating liquid into the lungs.My retail package included NO instructions for proper assembly of the Safestraw.  When I took mine apart for cleaning--it’s dishwasher safe--the float fell out, and I discovered that the float is bullet-shaped (not a cylinder).  After some experimentation, and after examining the product page photos closely, I believe that the pointed end of the float goes into the Safestraw tube first.A disability aid like this one, that must be regularly taken apart for cleaning, should include a leaflet on proper assembly, if it is possible to re-assemble the device incorrectly.  This Safestraw is intended for use with thin liquids only (milk, water, etc.).  Another Safestraw model is available for use with thick liquids (e.g., carbonated or pulpy beverages).",2.0 out of 5 stars
Helpful BUT No Instructions / Drinking Straw Required,"Pros: Discretely dispenses 1 tsp of water or other thin liquid per sip.Cons: Requires a drinking straw to function. Inadequate instructions on box.This little medical aid device is designed to work when a standard 1/4"" bendable drinking straw is inserted into it's top. Depending on the size and height of the drinking glass, and amount of beverage in the glass, for comfort, the straw may need to be trimmed to size.Although it may seem like a standard, inexpensive household item, a disposable, bendable drinking straw, readily available in almost all restaurants, kitchens, schools, and hospitals, may not be available to someone living at home with swallowing problems who has been invalided by surgery or disease and can't manage, or finds it a burden, to get out to shop at the supermarket, or drug store to purchase what they may consider to be an unnecessary, additional expense item.This is compounded by the absence of clear instructions on the box. There are instructions on the Amazon product page, but it is unrealistic to expect that the person requiring and using the drinking aid has either purchased the device themselves, adequately remembers the instructions, or has the product page open when first trying out the device.When used properly, the drinking aid (with straw attached) is inserted into the water. A first sip is taken to ""prime"" the device which then doses a teaspoon of liquid up into the straw. This small volume of water can then be safely swallowed and the sip then repeated.This particular device is for water and other very thin liquids only.A second, separate device is designed for thicker liquids such as ones that have nectar or other thickeners added.A major benefit of this device is that since it is small and sits in the liquid with only a standard straw exposed, it can be used discretely in a restaurant or any other public place.Disposable, bendable paper straws are environmentally friendly and are hygienic.The device is top rack dishwasher safe.It is highly recommended that the manufacturer include instructions in or on the product box and perhaps if a few ""starter"" straws were included as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Less Nauseous and less Gas,I have slot of stomach issues including Barrett's Esophagus . ThBionix Health at Home Safestraw is Fantastic! It gives me just the right amount of liquid I need without over doing it.  My straw fits right inside and the Safestraw hides in the beverage. This has helped me not over due my drinking with my meals in a tremendous way. I never knew how overboard I did it until I tested the Safestraw.  Im less nauseous for sure. And I don't get slot of gas. This is a blessing.If I was of any help to you. Please click below to. Let me know. Thank you so much.,5.0 out of 5 stars
for thin liquids,"Very important to note this white straw is for thin liquids only. If you need one for thick liquids you’ll need I buy the blue one. This straw helps prevent choking by limiting the fluid intake of a standard drinking straw. As the patient sips on the SafeStraw, the beverage flows through the valve and into the chamber causing the float to rise. After the float reaches the top of the chamber, the SafeStraw will prevent the patient from receiving any more fluid. Each sip will limit the fluid intake to approximately 6.2 ml (one teaspoon) allowing ability to control the liquid orally and safely swallow.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Doesn't work with all straws,"This straw was meant to work in conjunction with regular size drinking straws.  You cut off part of a regular straw and stick it on the end of this straw.  I have some straws that don't fit, so they don't fit all straws.  The patient has to sip once and then wait for the little doodad in the middle to go back down before sipping again.  Otherwise, the straw will get ""stuck.""  Only a little liquid can be sucked in at a time.  That helps with preventing choking.  Thin liquids only.  You can't use this with shakes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Needs one important issue improved,Has a critical flaw sadly. I very much wanted this to work. With my MS choking on liquids is scary and happens a lot during flairups. Understandable weakness comes with a flairup. And this is too hard to suck water/broth through. If that issue was fixed this would be an amazing help!,2.0 out of 5 stars
Good concept.  But it was not easy enough to master.,"This is a good idea, and potentially a really useful item.  But it was too hard for my friend to master, and it isn’t durable enough.The concept, it seems to me, is a good one, and a well-designed and sturdy safe straw is something that would make things easier for a lot of people. I hope that Bionix (or someone else) steps up.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Did not work for my husband,My husband said it didn't always dispense even the teaspoon of liquid as advertised.  He felt it was a chore to get enough liquid using it for the one day he tried it.  I would love to return at least the one unused we purchased.,1.0 out of 5 stars
It was recommended by a E,I recently purchased this item for my son who has a history of Epilepsy.  He developed Dysphagia three years ago as a result of uncontrolled seizures he has had in his life.  It was recommended by a E.N.T specialist to try this product as a tool to help control the intake amount of fluids.  I am very impressed with this volume drinking aid tool.  Very easy to assemble straw and easy to use. This drinking aid was worth ordering. Thank you so much for developing this tool.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Don’t buy it,"Awful. I have been a pediatric feeding specialist for years. Terrible design, straw too narrow for people w reduced lip protrusion and only fits plastic straws - which are no longer available in CA. Don’t waste your money.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Straw Works Great,"Bought this for a relative recovering from a stroke,  works great.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Potential,While the concept is great the actual product is flawed and seemingly very overpriced. This product has the potential to help certain people while others are still going to have problems. It is all depending on how it's used and who is using it because it can easily be manipulated into failing and still allow choking. If you are able to instruct the person using the straw on the proper usage and they comply it should go over well but if the person using it cannot follow instructions or comprehend how to properly use it then it's a waste of time & money to try. I am giving it a 3 star rating because it really does depend on the individual using it as to how well it works but I will never agree to the price because it's just a simple plastic item and the materials likely cost only pennies. Lower the price and the rating would go up one.,3.0 out of 5 stars
It does the job,"Item came in a box explaining what it is and how to use it. However was not pack into a protective pack or anything so of into a dishwasher it went. Kind of strange that it was not packed in a plastic baggy, but oh well.So what we liked:1. Made in USA - extra kudos for that2. its discreet3. works well enough4. dishwasher safeWhat we did not like it:1. once used - what do you do with it? need to bring your ziplock bag with you :(2. Was not packaged into a protective bag.Works decently enough - though not sure if its true to the volume it claims. As far as recommendations go - we were on the fence. So not sure.",3.0 out of 5 stars
GREAT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TROUBLE EATING...,"My grandmother drinks a lot more than she eats because of trouble eating/swallowing, & digesting food. This straw makes it easier for her, & I honestly think it’s a great buy. I do recommend it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
It's a succcess,With a hiatal hernia and dysphagia this is a salvation. I am extremely grateful for this invention. My recommendation for people who have these conditions is to have several and also one in the wallet for when we go out to eat out. It is easy to clean. Highly recommended,5.0 out of 5 stars
Works well,"Easy to use. Need to cut a piece of a straw to attach to it, but it is pretty straight forward and indeed slows the flow of a thin beverage so the person doesn’t cough as much while drinking. Much better alternative than the drink thickeners.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bit Tricky to Use,"Got this for Granny. No instructions were really provided, at least nothing detailed. Seemed to provide too much water? Granny said she would pass on using it.",3.0 out of 5 stars
