Overpriced but works as described,"I Initially gave this cup 1 star because it leaked. I called the 800 number and the manufacturer walked me through the correct placement of the handles, which corrected the leaking issue. The handles snap on and once on, should not be removed again. When correctly attached, the handles should slightly overlap the top rim of the cup.  I was also instructed not to fill the cup all the way to the fill line and to take apart the two parts of the lid for cleaning. NThat said, I still feel the cup is overpriced. Also, my father does not like that he has to tip his head so far back to sip from the cup.",3.0 out of 5 stars
The Provale Cup dispenses 1 Tbsp of un-thickened liquid at a time and it did satisfy his thirst until he was able to heal and ...,After my husband's series of seizures it left his esophagus damaged and he aspirated making it necessary to drink honey thickened fluids.  He has always be a huge water drinker and the thickened liquids did not quench his thirst at all.  The Provale Cup dispenses 1 Tbsp of un-thickened liquid at a time and it did satisfy his thirst until he was able to heal and drink liquids out of a normal cup again.,5.0 out of 5 stars
A truly amazing cup to assist my husband in swallowing without aspirating,A truly amazing cup to assist my husband in swallowing without aspirating.

Overpriced,"This cup is overpriced considering the fact that it leaks non stop. I have to change my clients shirt any time she wants to drink anything other than water. For $36+ you'd think they could design this a little better. Breaks too easily, accidental drops are bound to happen with the population that need these devices.We're searching for another alternative rather than waste her limited funds on another of these.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Does Amazon want to keep customers?,"Unfortunately these cups were flawed in that the 2 handles could not be placed on the cup because it caused leakage. We were able to make it work with one handle. But for the price, it was a cheap product. Returning them was not an option. We tried other types but to no avail. We found ourselves returning items and now that Amazon has this new return policy...(too many returns will knock me off their customer list) we decided to keep this defective product.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Safe drinking but could be better designed.,"Since the product is the only one on the market that’s available to buy and ship to the EU, I understand that they are able to put their price so high and I thought if it is life saving coz my dad won’t drown himself while drinking it will be great. I have used the only other brand’s version before a lot and it was always leak proof and great but this one has a hole at the back of the rim of the lid which isn’t covered properly by the rim of the main cup.. I thought this was to stop vacuum but is way too big and more comes out of it there than the actual sipping opening of the cup. Which my dad noticed and started drinking out of there which made the whole cup pointless as it’s meant to only let 5mls out at once. The lid doesn’t click in and doesn’t screw on it’s a push on one but it doesn’t seem to go all the way on one side, I tried with a lot of force it’s annoying it doesn’t leak there though so the actual seal would be ok if it didn’t have a hole at the back. It’s good that the handles are removable, as first I put both on but my dad held it the wrong side and was trying to  drink with the sipping bit down... so I could remove and he can work is out now. He does often think that the opposite flap that we can use to open it is the bit where he should be drinking from it so I need to remind him that it’s the other way.Though, if the cup isn’t tipped backwards, it wouldn’t leak that much but it’s hard not to when someone is ill and has coordination problems.I tried to drink out of the cup several times and we used it with thickened fluids and I had to tip it almost 180 degrees to get all of the 5mls out but that makes it quite safe and when my dad does manage to use it it is a safe way of drinking for him so I’m happy to leave the cup with him to drink when unsupervised.Overall makes me feel safer about his drinking but could be better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Disappointed with the cup,"This cup was purchased for my husband who has Parkinson's. His swallowing of liquids needs to controlled in by using a cup that delivers only 2 tablespoons of liquid at one time which it does. The problem with the cup is that it does leak when the person is lifting the cup to their mouth.  In order to get the liquid the person needs to lift and tilt the cup quite high. This is very difficult for someone with Parkinson's whose motor skills are weak. Also, the price of this cup is much too expensive.",2.0 out of 5 stars
$37 FA WHATTTT???,Can you say INEFFECTIVE ADULT SIPPY CUP. I bought this for my father who had stopped eating and drinking.  At a high recommendation I bought this cup as we were trying to reintroduce food and drink. The cup had oxymoron-ish directions and leaked. It was totally over priced for its ineffectiveness.  GARBAGE. I could have gone to the dollar store and bout a child's sippy cup with no leaks and no confusing directions.,1.0 out of 5 stars
This cup only works if the drinker has the ability to and knows how to suck through spout,"This cup is NOT for everyone who has a dysphagia diagnosis. The person must be able to such the drink through the spout. This cup does not act like a sippy cut that ""pours"" into the mouth.  I ordered this for my brother, but he is unable to use it. I feel this information should be included in the product description.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Not worth the money,"This cup needs to be redesigned? You can not fill it to the ""line"". By the way,the line is very hard to see . If you fill it all the way to the invisible line it leaks.It's a good idea if only it worked. In my case it's not worth the trouble or the expense,it is overpriced.",1.0 out of 5 stars
The Perfect Solution,"My husband recently suffered aspiration pneumonia and was cautioned to drink small sips of liquid at a time.  He has mobility issues with his hands so his caregiver and I were attempting to control the amount of liquid he could sip.  He had stopped drinking as much, which is not a good thing.  This cup, suggested by dysphagia staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, CA, has been the perfect solution.  It works as described and the handles make it easy for my husband to handle the cup himself.  I don't have to worry that he is taking in too much liquid at a time.  I highly recommend this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Won't work with thickened beverages,Bought this for my wife who has serious swallowing problems. She can only drink thickened beverages. It wasn't until we received this and read the paperwork that we found this does NOT work with thickened beverages. And it is not returnable. So I am stuck with a $40 paperwight,1.0 out of 5 stars
Not a solution for my husband's dysphasia,"The cup was impossible to assemble, by me or the nurses in the nursing home, so I returned it.

Didn’t work as expected.,"Our doctor recommended the Provale cup after a swallow study.  This cup didn’t deliver measured liquid as expected. I purchased for my husband who has dysphasia due to progressive neurological disease.  He tried it for two weeks, but choked with most sips.  In order to get liquid out, he had to tip it to almost 90 degrees, and it sometimes leaked.  I felt we paid $36 for three pieces of plastic that just didn’t deliver what we needed.

We had to watch her to ensure she was only taking small sips, but this cup only lets her get small sips. This helped alleviate the worry out of having to constantly watch her. It is a bit hard to take apart for washing as it’s a snug fit, but it would leak if it were loose. Would highly recommend this product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Dysphagia Cup,These cups have worked well for my mother who has Dysphagia.  They let her get off the thickened liquid that she hated and back onto water.The parts of the cup can be difficult to get apart and you have to be a little careful to keep from cracking the cup base.

DO NOT USE if you are worried about aspiration.,"While the idea of this product is great, the execution is not. We purchased this product for my 82 year old grandmother who has difficulty swallowing, she aspirates very easily; this has caused her lungs to become infected with pneumonia. The doctor in the hospital suggested that we try this cup which we promptly ordered. Upon receiving the cup I noticed three major flaws:The cup itself is quite large and was a bit cumbersome for her (she is small and currently quite weak from the pneumonia). It was difficult even to hold it myself and help her to drink from it.In the amount of time that it took that one small teaspoon to travel from the bottom of the dosing core to the mouth she took at least four breaths. The whole point of this cup was so that she wouldn't breathe in the liquid. If she is breathing while the liquid is being poured into her mouth then that defeats the purpose.The angle at which she had to tilt her head (all the way back) to finally get the liquid into her mouth is flat out dangerous. To avoid aspiration one is supposed to tilt their chin down, NOT all the way back.While this cup may work well for certain swallowing disorders, I DO NOT recommend that you try it when attempting to avoid aspiration.",1.0 out of 5 stars

cup to use when only small sips are to be taken to help improve swallowing ; cup only works with regular thin liquids,excellent cup for people with swallow difficulty/dysphagia which allows one teaspoon sized sip be taken at a time. recommend not to clean in dishwasher since cup lid does not fit well after cleaned and liquids leak out of cup.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Is your cup leaking? They have a front and a back!,"I am a speech pathologist and regularly recommend and utilize this cup for my dysphagia patients. Recently made a realization that I think most people don't know. The cups have a front and a back. I have never ordered a brand new cup, I've only utilized existing ones, in the directions it mentions a vent. It is obvious on the lid, but very hard to see on the cup, I can only see it if I hold it up to the light, but you can feel it if you run your finger around the rim on the inside. It also helps to not fill the liquid all the way to the fill line. I have seen a few people ask about putting thickened liquids in these cups; they are for thin liquids only. Also, your loved one / patient will need decent range of motion in their neck/shoulder to utilize the cups. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars
This works,My husband used one of these in the hospital due to swallowing difficulties after radiation for tongue cancer. He was choking a lot and getting fluid in his lungs and developed aspiration pneumonia and septic shock.

Excellent for adults with dysphagia,"This cup is the only product on the market that I am aware of- that reduces the flow administered during drinking.  I work with adults with developmental disabilities as well as adults with neuro and cognitive deficits, and this product is excellent in helping them reduce the amount of liquid that is swallowed per sip.  I find 5  cc's is desirable with most dysphagic patients who require this level of support.  It can occasionally leak, but I don't find that to be a major problem.  Sturdy design and goes through an industrial dish washer without issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Simply amazing,"If you have dysphasia – trouble swallowing – and even good efforts result in chronic coughing as your lungs struggle to keep the stuff you don't swallow out of your windpipe, this cup is amazing. It is like living in a new world.The whole point of it is to deliver to you a very small amount of liquid, I believe it is a teaspoon at 5 cc. I had thought I was being careful in taking small sips as I ate, but this measured amount is much smaller than the sips I had been taking. Result? Eating a meal – of course, very small portions of food – WITHOUT COUGHING. A change in my standard of living, and in the risk of pneumonia. Far, far more than I had expected.An additional benefit… since you are not coughing after each sip, you can take sip after sip one right after the other! NO COUGHING!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
