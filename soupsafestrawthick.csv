This is an amazing product for people that have dysphagia or swallowing issues!,"This product has been a dysphagia lifesaver!  I came back to order more so we can have more than 1 drink availalable at one time (i.e. coffee and water).  We have an elderly parent with advanced Parkinson disease and serious swallowing issues.  He has been told ""no straws"" by the speech therapist after several bouts of aspirational pneumonia and failed barium swallowing studies. He has major motor skill issues and couldn't use his straw cups with lids so he was spilling constantly!  He had practically stopped drinking fluids out of frustration by the time this arrived.  We have used it throughout the last few days and he has eagerly enjoyed it with hot coffee, iced tea, and water, with excellent results.  I am so thankful someone invented this!!  This product is not hard to keep clean.  It is a hard plastic stem with a steel valve that comes out, and a flexible silicone stopper on the bottom, it is disassembled and washed in less than a minute. It seems to be made from very durable material. After assembly of the stem, you clip the bottom few inches off of a disposable straw (we like the bendy kind) and stick the straw on the stem.If could give this 10 stars I would.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Took a little getting used to, but they work great.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone with the same problem.  A little expensive, but worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Not enough allowed,Ordered for my husband and after a few trials he refused to use it.  Only allowed about half a swallow so a regular straw was easier for one full swallow.,1.0 out of 5 stars
